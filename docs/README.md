# Docs index

User docs are the [Documenter site](https://jowch.github.io/Masque.jl), built from
[`docs/src/`](src/). Maintainer notes are [`docs/dev/`](dev/):

Building the site runs every example notebook (`docs/export_notebooks.jl`) to produce its
static export, so a local build takes several minutes on a warm depot and longer cold.
Set `MASQUE_SKIP_NOTEBOOK_EXPORT=true` to reuse the exports already in `docs/src/notebooks/`
from a previous build when iterating on prose. Set `MASQUE_SKIP_EMBED_EXPORT=true` to reuse
harvested cell-series players in `docs/src/embeds/`.

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [`architecture.md`](dev/architecture.md) | The design contract: `AbstractBackend`/`AbstractInteractable`, the geometry primitives between them, the manifest shape, tooltips wire format. |
| [`backend-comparison.md`](dev/backend-comparison.md) | Cost/latency comparison between the `:cairo` and `:webgl` backends. |
| [`frontend-delivery.md`](dev/frontend-delivery.md) | Browser-side build/delivery decisions: bundling, manifest transport, DPI/sizing, JS testing, CI. |
| [`live-interaction-checklist.md`](dev/live-interaction-checklist.md) | The live-verification playbook run against a real Pluto + browser before any user-facing change is called done. |
| [`perf-findings.md`](dev/perf-findings.md) | The measured payload-size and click-latency envelope; the single source of those numbers for the rest of the docs. |
| [`roadmap.md`](dev/roadmap.md) | Open work, non-goals, and the order to tackle it. |
