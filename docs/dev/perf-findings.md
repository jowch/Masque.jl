## The two payload terms

From `src/render.jl` `show`, a rendered cell ships two payloads (the click *return* value —
`{layer,index,payload}` — is tiny and not a factor):

| Term | Carried by | Cost driver | Regenerated |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **base64 PNG** | HTML `<img src="data:…">` | output pixel area × visual density | every render |
| **manifest** | `published_to_js` (MsgPack on the wire) | #hit-elements × per-element payload | every render |

The "large base64 → editor lag" warning in Q5 is about the **PNG**. The manifest is the term
that **future features inflate** (tooltips, animation frames, multi-select).

**JS bundle (one-time, per page-load):** `assets/overlay.js` is inlined per cell and idempotent
(no repeated download cost). M2.3 bundled d3-format as the **first runtime JS dependency**, growing
the committed bundle **10 828 → 17 515 bytes raw minified** (+6 687 B raw; ~2–2.5 KB gzipped delta).
This is a one-time delivery cost per page-load, independent of manifest or PNG size.

PR #72 split `overlay.ts` into modules threaded through a shared `OverlayState`/`OverlayCtx`
object — object properties survive esbuild's identifier minification, so that refactor grew
`assets/overlay.js` **27 364 → 29 736 bytes** (+2 372 B), then to **35 133 bytes** after #75's
keyboard/a11y work. Enabling esbuild's `mangleProps: /_$/` (every frontend-internal
`OverlayState`/`OverlayCtx`/`ROIBox`/`Drag`/`FocusRef`/`Hit` field renamed to a trailing-`_`
convention — see `frontend-delivery.md`'s Bundle row) recovered most of that: **35 133 → 33 048
bytes** (−2 085 B, ~5.9%). `assets/masque-webgl.js` is unaffected (**1 173 bytes**, unchanged) —
`wgl-shim.ts` has no `OverlayState`-shaped internal properties to mangle, and its two wire-tag
properties (`__obs__`/`__t__`) are read via bracket notation specifically so `mangleProps` can
never touch them. Both bundles remain byte-identical across repeated `npm run build` runs.

## Measured envelope

base64 PNG decoded size (KB) and manifest MsgPack size (KB), default 700px column (px_per_unit 2):

| Plot | PNG | manifest | note |
|------|----:|---------:|------|
| line, 10 pts | 51 | 0.5 | ~50 KB antialiasing/text floor for any plot |
| scatter, 100 | 35 | 4 | |
| scatter, 1 000 | 188 | 38 | typical interactive plot |
| scatter, 10 000 | 717 | 379 | manifest approaches PNG; both O(N) |
| heatmap, 50×50 | 30 | 13 | |
| heatmap, 200×200 | 190 | 197 | grid edges are compact, but `values[]` is O(cells) |

(Element geometry ships as `Vector{Int}` — quantized to integer pixels (architecture.md §9), so the
msgpack sizer counts each coord at 1–3 B, not Float32's flat 5. This trimmed the geometry term ~17 %
overall: scatter-1000 46→38 KB, scatter-10000 459→379 KB. Heatmaps barely move — their `values[]`
are *data* and stay Float32. The remaining per-element cost is now dominated by the payload's
Float64 `x`/`y`, not geometry.)

**The knee.** A realistic single interactive plot is **50–400 KB total** — at/just above the
"10–100 KB+ plausible" band from Q5, not below the "<10 KB" anecdote. Editor lag is not expected
here. It becomes a real risk only at the extremes below.

### What scales the manifest
- **Per-element count** is linear: ~38 bytes/element (3 Int geometry coords at 1–3 B each + a small
  payload whose `x`/`y` stay Float64). 10 000 elements → ~379 KB.
- **Heatmaps carry the full value matrix** (`:grid` geometry's `values[]`, O(cells)): 200×200 ≈
  198 KB. By design — that value already feeds the `{i,j,value}` hover readout; M2.3 confirmed
  no extra cost for heatmaps (template + tipStyle are O(1) per layer, not per-cell).
- **px_per_unit (display width)** scales the PNG ~quadratically with width but **does not** touch
  the manifest (geometry is pixel coords; the count is unchanged): scatter-1000 PNG 90 KB @300px
  → 187 KB @700px, manifest ~38 KB both.

### Render latency (Julia half of the click→re-render round-trip)
`@elapsed masque(fig)`, warmed, best-of-3. The click message is tiny and Pluto auto-throttles stale
events, so the felt latency is dominated by Julia re-rendering + re-encoding. Browser paint +
websocket transfer ride on top (needs live Pluto to measure — see Not measured).

| Plot | render + encode |
|------|----:|
| scatter 1 000 | ~70 ms |
| scatter 10 000 | ~280 ms |
| heatmap 200×200 | ~45 ms |

Sub-second for click selection across the board. The floor is the ~45–70 ms Cairo render.

### Full click round-trip (live Pluto + headless browser)
Measured end-to-end in a real Pluto kernel + Chromium: reproduce the overlay's exact bond commit
(`host.value = {layer,index,payload}` + `dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("input"))`, what
`overlay.ts` does on click), then time until the downstream cell's re-rendered `<img>` lands in
the DOM. The downstream cell bakes the event index into the figure so a **genuinely new ~40 KB
PNG** is rendered, shipped over the websocket, decoded and painted each round-trip (the heavy
path, not just an overlay re-highlight). 15 samples, scatter-50:

| | round-trip |
|------|----:|
| median | **65 ms** |
| min | 61 ms |
| p90 | 121 ms |
| max | 241 ms |

The round-trip is **essentially the Julia render floor (~45–70 ms) plus only ~tens of ms** of
websocket transfer + decode + paint. So browser overhead is *not* the bottleneck — render time is.
Extrapolating with the render table: a scatter-10 000 click (~280 ms render + ~717 KB PNG over
localhost) lands well under ~400 ms. The client-side hit-test (~0 ms, not in this number) adds
nothing felt. Two caveats: localhost websocket (no network latency), and Pluto's selection
*re-highlight* is cheaper still (overlay-drawn → no new PNG, manifest-only round-trip).

### `@bind` view-commit baseline (drag-to-orbit release, this commit)

Measured **2026-09-19 at commit `e9a71f3`**, Julia 1.12.7, Pluto **1.0.3**, CairoMakie 0.15.14,
headless Chromium (Playwright) — a one-off measurement, more so than the round-trip numbers
above — no committed driver at all (see the header note). Pluto's version is recorded because the
double remount below depends on it: the scene's widget cell both defines the `@bind` and reads its
own previous bond value back, and a cell that does that is not a sanctioned Pluto use case
([issue #83](https://github.com/jowch/Masque.jl/issues/83), closed not-planned after the
mechanism was traced into Pluto's own bond-cache timing). Nothing about that shape is
contractual, so a different Pluto version can show a different remount count without that being
a regression.

Scene: `Axis3`, a 240-point helix `lines!` + a 12-marker `scatter!`,
`[ViewInteractable(ax), PointInteractable(ax, pts)]` as the interactable set, figure 480×360 at
`px_per_unit=2` (today's default). Driven through the real `masque(fig, ints)` with a deliberately
constructed self-referencing camera-`Ref` cell — the shape the shipped examples avoid:
`examples/demo.jl` has no view-manipulation cells at all, and `examples/view_manip.jl` uses the
opposite, acyclic shape (a plain `orb_seed` tuple, `@bind orb_ev`, and a separate
`orbit_committed` cell) precisely because Pluto forbids feeding a bond back into the same figure
cell (`examples/view_manip.jl`'s own markdown cell says so). Instrumented with `performance.now()`
at a synthetic `pointerup` dispatch, plus a poll on `.ip-host` node identity — identity-diffed
every 15 ms (not a fixed-interval `waitChange` poll) so the ~100–300 ms window isn't buried in
coarser polling noise. 12 drag-release trials.

**Reconstruction, not a committed driver** — not runnable as-written; captures the notebook cell
shape and measurement approach well enough to rebuild by hand:

```julia
# Cell A — once-init camera Ref, a separate Pluto cell so it does NOT re-run (and
# reset) every time cell B below does.
cam = Ref((0.4, 0.5))

# Cell B — the self-referencing @bind: this SAME cell both defines the bond (`ev`)
# and reads back its own previous value, which is the shape issue #83 investigated.
begin
    if @isdefined(ev) && ev !== nothing && ev isa InteractionEvent && ev.layer === :view
        cam[] = (Float64(ev.payload.azimuth), Float64(ev.payload.elevation))
    end
    fig = Figure(; size = (480, 360))
    ax = Axis3(fig[1, 1]; azimuth = cam[][1], elevation = cam[][2])
    ts = range(0, 6π, 240)
    lines!(ax, cos.(ts), sin.(ts), ts ./ 6; linewidth = 3)
    pts = Makie.Point3f.(cos.(ts[1:20:end]), sin.(ts[1:20:end]), ts[1:20:end] ./ 6)
    scatter!(ax, pts; markersize = 14, color = :tomato)
    @bind ev masque(fig, [ViewInteractable(ax), PointInteractable(ax, pts)])
end
```

```js
// Playwright, against the notebook above: dispatch a synthetic pointerdown/move/
// pointerup drag on the widget's `.surface`, stamp performance.now() at pointerup,
// then poll `document.querySelector(".ip-host")` identity every 15 ms — each
// distinct node identity seen after release is one remount.
```

| metric | p50 | p95 |
|---|---:|---:|
| release → bond value committed (Julia `masque()` done + Pluto's own reactive-run overhead) | 105.7 ms | 214.6 ms |
| release → **final** DOM update (last `.ip-host` replacement) | 201.5 ms | 294.6 ms |

Every one of the 12 trials produced exactly two distinct `.ip-host` node identities for one
release — the unsupported-shape double remount described in issue #83, reproduced live on this
Pluto version rather than only inferred from its description.

This section deliberately does not include any `with_js_link` numbers — those live in
[issue #102](https://github.com/jowch/Masque.jl/issues/102) until a `with_js_link` gesture
channel actually ships. This file tracks only what Masque does today.

## Stress test — the extremes (where it stops being render-bound)

Pushing past the normal envelope (live round-trips + a pure-Julia sweep to 10× the sizes above):

**Live round-trip vs total payload — the crossover.** Same method as above, heavier downstream:

| Downstream re-render | PNG | manifest | round-trip (median) | render floor | non-render overhead |
|----------------------|----:|---------:|--------------------:|-------------:|--------------------:|
| scatter 50 (tiny) | 40 KB | ~3 KB | 65 ms | ~50 ms | ~15 ms |
| scatter 10 000 | 768 KB | 459 KB | 335 ms | ~280 ms | **~55 ms** |
| heatmap 1000×1000 | 2.13 MB | **4.78 MB** | **553 ms** | ~260 ms | **~290 ms** |

> These two rows are **pre-change live snapshots** (dated, not regenerated). The wire format has since
> shrunk both manifests: scatter-10000 is now ~379 KB (int-pixel geometry, this PR), and the 1000²
> heatmap ships ~6 KB (its sub-pixel `values[]` is dropped by the PR #8 cap), so that exact heatmap is
> now **render-bound** (~120 ms render), not the 553 ms payload-bound case shown. The 553 ms remains a

(PNG sizes here are the live browser-measured transferred bytes; manifest sizes are from the bench.
The render floor is bench `masque(fig)` — it excludes the `published_to_js` msgpack serialization
of the manifest, which happens at `show` time and is part of the non-render overhead.)

Below ~1 MB total, the round-trip is **render-bound** and browser/transfer overhead is a near-constant
~15–55 ms. Above a few MB it flips to **payload-bound**: the 553 ms above is mostly *not* render — it's
`published_to_js` msgpack-serializing a 4.78 MB manifest + shipping ~7 MB over the wire + paint. Nothing
crashed; it degrades gracefully into the half-second range. The crossover sits around **~1–10 MB total**.
Post-wire-shrink (int-pixel geometry + the `values[]` cap), the case that *reaches* that regime by
default is **high-N scatter** (200 000 pts → 7.72 MB manifest), not heatmaps — the cap keeps even a 1 M-cell
heatmap render-bound.

**The manifest is the high-N wall, not the PNG** (pure-Julia sweep):

| Case | PNG | manifest | render |
|------|----:|---------:|-------:|
| scatter 50 000 | 791 KB | 1.88 MB | ~940 ms |
| scatter 100 000 | 303 KB | 3.83 MB | ~1.6 s |
| scatter 200 000 | 71 KB | **7.72 MB** | ~3.0 s |
| heatmap 300×300 (cells visible) | 388 KB | 441 KB | ~50 ms |
| heatmap 1000×1000 (cells sub-pixel) | 2.26 MB | **6 KB** | ~120 ms |
| scatter 50 000 + 200 B payload/elem | 47 KB | **10.2 MB** | ~1.35 s |

- **PNG is non-monotonic in N** — past saturation, dense random scatter compresses to a near-solid mass
  (200 000 pts → only 71 KB), while the **manifest grows strictly O(N) to 7.7 MB** (int-pixel geometry,
  this PR; was 9.28 MB at Float32). At high element counts the manifest, not the image, is the ceiling.
- **Heatmap render stays cheap (~120 ms even at 1 M cells)** — Cairo blits the raster. The manifest
  carries the value matrix (O(cells)) **only while cells are targetable**: at 300² (visible) it's 441 KB,
  but at 1000² the cells go sub-pixel and the values cap (PR #8) drops the matrix → 6 KB. So a giant
  heatmap is no longer the payload wall it was; high-N *scatter* is.
- **Raw canvas pixels are *not* a payload driver for sparse content**: a 3200×2000 figure with 2 000
  points produced a *smaller* PNG (132 KB) than a 600×400 one — density drives PNG size, not resolution.
- **What actually shrinks the multi-MB manifest** (de-speculated by `bench/encoding_experiment.jl`, real
  MsgPack bytes — see the encoding experiment below): **int-pixel geometry** (−58% on the geometry term,
  no structural change) and **capping heatmap `values[]`** (−499×). **Both now shipped** — the values cap
  in PR #8, int-pixel quantization here. The TypedArray binary fast-path, which I first guessed was the
  lever, buys only ~5% over int-quantization and is *not* worth the manifest-shape change.

### Encoding experiment (de-speculation)
`bench/encoding_experiment.jl` MsgPack-encodes a real 50k-circle geometry and a 1000² heatmap `values[]`
under each scheme — replacing theoretical byte math with measured wire bytes:

| Encoding | bytes/coord | 50k circles | note |
|----------|------------:|------------:|------|
| `Float32` (current, nested or typed) | 5.00 | 732 KB | baseline |
| **int-pixel quantized** (generic) | **2.10** | **307 KB** | **−58%, no manifest-shape change** |
| Int16 raw binary (Pluto TypedArray) | 2.00 | 293 KB | only ~5% beyond int-quant → not worth the rewrite |

| Heatmap 1000² `values[]` | size |
|---|---:|
| with `values[]` (uncapped) | 4.78 MB |
| capped → `{i,j}` only | 9.8 KB (**499× smaller**) |

Both wins **shipped**: the `values[]` cap in `52f174c` (PR #8), and **int-pixel geometry quantization
in PR #9** (element geometry vectors are `Int`, `architecture.md §9`). The
experiment's −58%/2.10-B-per-coord is the *geometry-term* saving; on a whole realistic manifest (where
the payload's Float64 `x`/`y` dilute it) it lands ~17 % — see the envelope table. AxisTransform stays
Float64. The measured experiment numbers above are unchanged — they just describe what now ships.

**Conclusion:** the cheap, non-structural wins (int-pixel coords + `values[]` cap) capture essentially all
of it; the structural typed-array fast-path does not earn its cost. `Float16` is a non-starter (no MsgPack
float16; lossy >2048px). Keep `AxisTransform` lims `Float64` (drag inversion) — quantize geometry only.

## Scope bounds for downstream phases

- **Phase 2a bars/areas/spans** *(delivered, 2026-06-30)* — Hist, Waterfall, CrossBar, HSpan,
  VSpan now auto-extracted as `:rects`. The payload schema grew from `(; index)` to a semantic
  shape per surface type (a few numbers per element — see `architecture.md` §3 bar payload
  schema). Bars/spans are inherently low-N (tens to low hundreds of elements for any realistic
  chart), so the per-element payload growth has negligible envelope impact. Bench re-run
  (2026-06-30) confirms the §A envelope is unchanged — see §A. No new manifest terms, no new
  per-element geometry (`:rects` was already quantized); the only wire change is richer payload
  fields per bar element.

- **Phase 2b polygon surfaces** *(delivered, commit `431bd99`, 2026-06-30)* — Band, Density,
  Contourf, Violin, Voronoiplot, BoxPlot now auto-extracted as `:polygons` (plus `:rects` for
  un-notched BoxPlot bodies). Ring geometry ships as a `Vector{Vector{Real}}` — one subvector per
  polygon element, flat `[x0,y0,x1,y1,…]` — with vertex coords quantized to integer pixels (the same
  1–3 B/coord path as scatter; see architecture.md §9). Bench §F (2026-06-30, `bench/payload_envelope.jl`):

  | Surface | elements | total verts | manifest | ~B/elem | ~B/vert |
  |---------|--------:|------------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
  | band, 100 x-pts (1 ring) | 1 | 200 | 1.5 KB | 1 494 | 6 |
  | violin, 3 groups (~400 verts/ring each) | 3 | 1 206 | 7.3 KB | 2 479 | 6 |
  | contourf, 50×50, default levels | 20 | 1 780 | 10.5 KB | 537 | 6 |

  The fundamental rate is **~6 B/vertex** (2 coords × ~3 B each at typical 700-px plot widths),
  consistent across all polygon kinds. Per-element cost is vertex-count-driven: a violin KDE ring
  (~400 verts) is ~2.5 KB/element — far above scatter's per-element cost (§A) — because the ring
  boundary is large. But realistic polygon charts have low element counts: a 3-violin plot is 7.3 KB
  total; a 20-piece contourf is 10.5 KB total — both well under the render-bound / payload-bound
  crossover (~1 MB). A high-cell voronoiplot (e.g. 1 000 cells, each a few vertices) could reach
  scatter-scale manifest sizes (scatter per-element × 1 000 → a few hundred KB; cf. §A), but is still
  render-bound. The §A–E envelope is
  **unchanged** — bench re-run (2026-06-30) confirms all existing scatter/heatmap numbers are
  identical; the `:polygons` term is an addition, not a modification of prior geometry kinds.

- **Text labels** *(delivered, this arc, 2026-07-01)* — `text!` and `annotation!` labels
  auto-extracted as `:rects` click-to-pick buttons (`TextInteractable`); no new geometry kind (rides
  the same primitive as bars/heatmap cells). The only new wire term is the payload's `text` string —
  `(; text, index, x, y)` replaces `(; index, x, y)`. Bench §G (2026-07-01, `bench/payload_envelope.jl`):

  | Case | labels | manifest | ~B/label | geometry | payload |
  |------|-------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|--------:|
  | scatter+labels (picker, 5 short labels) | 5 | 0.8 KB | 51 | 8 B (4-int `:rects` box) | 43 B |
  | text-only (100 labels, ~4-char strings) | 100 | 4.9 KB | 47 | 8 B (4-int `:rects` box) | 39 B |

  Per-label cost is **tiny and render-bound**: the `:rects` box is the usual 4 quantized ints
  (~8 B), and the payload is one short string (`text`) plus three numbers (`index`, `x`, `y` —
  `y` and `x` stay Float64 like every other point-anchored payload, `index` is a small int) — a few
  tens of bytes total, in the same range as a bar-chart element (see Phase 2a above), not a
  polygon-ring element (see Phase 2b above, ~hundreds–thousands of B/elem). Text is also inherently
  low-N: unlike scatter points, labels need screen-space room to stay legible, so realistic figures
  carry tens, not thousands, of them — a 100-label figure (already a dense label grid, not a
  realistic chart) is still under 5 KB. The §A–G envelope is **unchanged** — bench re-run
  (2026-07-01) confirms all existing scatter/heatmap/polygon numbers are identical; the text term is
  an addition, not a modification of prior geometry kinds.

- **M2.3 Richer tooltips** *(delivered, PR #10)* — the original
  prediction was correct: shipping per-element tooltip strings would grow the manifest by `Σ(tooltip
  bytes)`. Measured upper bounds (bench section B / Stress D): 1 000 elements × 200-byte HTML each =
  +196 KB (14 → 210 KB); 50 000 elements × 200 B each = **10.2 MB manifest** → payload-bound
  ~0.5 s+ round-trip. M2.3 avoided this by design: the per-element `tooltips[]` array was **not
  shipped** in the manifest. Instead, each layer that has a tooltip carries two O(1)-per-layer
  terms — `template` (a small segments array evaluated per hover) and a top-level `tipStyle`
  (CSS-var dict). The **default per-element envelope is unchanged** — confirmed by M2.3 bench
  re-run: scatter-1000 → 38 KB manifest, scatter-10000 → 379 KB manifest. The JS bundle grew by
  ~6.7 KB raw (10 828 → 17 515 B) to bundle d3-format (see "Two payload terms" above); this is
  a one-time delivery cost, not a per-manifest term.
- **M4 Animation / scrubbing** — frames are pre-baked PNGs: **total = frames × per-frame PNG**.
  Measured: a 187-KB plot × 30 frames = **5.5 MB**, × 120 = **22 MB**. This is the hard ceiling
  of the roadmap. Animation **must** shrink per-frame cost (smaller canvas / lower px_per_unit /
  fewer frames) or it trips the "framework-revisit" payload trigger. A naive full-res scrub is
  not viable. (Stress: a 1200×800 / 5 k-scatter frame is 492 KB → 300 frames = 144 MB, 1000 = 481 MB.)
- **SVG output path** — out of this bench (raster only). The roadmap already gates SVG behind a
  primitive-count viability spike; the PNG floor here (~50 KB even for 10 points) is the number
  SVG must *beat* to be worth it for sparse plots.
- **`ViewInteractable` / `:view` kind** *(drag-to-pan/orbit, this PR)* — one full-viewport bbox
  layer + mode/`azimuth`/`elevation` fields. Envelope impact is noise relative to PNG + per-element
  geometry (same order as a single ROI layer). Full `bench/payload_envelope.jl` re-run deferred;
  reconcile on the next manifest-shape change that adds per-element or frame payload.
- **Multi-select / box-select** *(delivered, M4 commit `d05318f`)* — the M4 wire change is a
  single small `selects` string per selector ROI layer (added to the outbound manifest); the
  selection vector or region descriptor is the **inbound** `@bind` return value, not part of the
  outbound manifest envelope measured here. The §A envelope cases contain no selector layer, so the
  `selects` string never appears in them — the 2026-06-29 bench re-run therefore confirms §A is
  unchanged trivially (the term simply isn't exercised there). When a selector *is* present it adds
  one short string per selector ROI layer to the outbound manifest; on the inbound path a selection
  is K events × ~tens of bytes (or a fixed-size region descriptor) — never a size concern. The
  contract change, not the size, was the work.

- **Colorbar readout (`valueaxis` field)** *(delivered, PR #27, 2026-06-30)* —
  `AxisTransform` gains a `valueaxis::Union{Nothing,Symbol}` field (serialized as `valueaxis?: "x"|"y"|null`
  in MsgPack). For all non-colorbar transforms it serializes as `null` — one nullable key per
  transform entry, negligible at the KB scale of the §A envelope. A colorbar contributes one
  additional `:axis` HitLayer (bbox geometry — four integer coords, a handful of bytes) and its own
  `AxisTransform` entry with `valueaxis: "x"` or `"y"`. Bench re-run (2026-06-30,
  `bench/payload_envelope.jl`) confirms the §A–F envelope is **unchanged** within noise — the
  `valueaxis` field and the colorbar `:axis` layer are invisible at the KB scale of the envelope
  table. The §A scatter/heatmap numbers are identical to the previous run.

## JS hit-test microbenchmark

Every claim above that "hit-test is ~0 ms" was from the pure-Julia render sweep, which doesn't
touch `frontend/src/geometry.ts`'s `hitTest`. `frontend/bench/hit_test.bench.ts` (`npm run bench`,
committed) times `hitTest` directly: for each kind × N, build one `HitLayer` of N random elements
scattered over a 4000×4000 px canvas, and time 2000 query points (one warm-up pass discarded) two
ways — **mixed** (random points over that same canvas) and **miss** (one point guaranteed to miss
every element). The two diverge for `circles`/`rects`: `hitLayer` returns on the first hit, so a
**mixed** query's cost depends on the *hit rate*, which rises with density — at fixed canvas size
and growing N, mixed stops measuring a scan and starts measuring the early-return path. **miss**
is the O(n) worst case (and the realistic case for hovering empty space on a sparse plot);
`segments`/`polyline` have no early exit at all, so their mixed and miss numbers agree. `grid`
(`findBin`, this PR's change) is timed the same way over an m×m-cell grid spanning the canvas —
every mixed query lands in some cell (100% hit rate) so mixed and miss both exercise the binary
search, just from different starting points.

Run 2026-09-14, Linux x86_64 (single workstation core), Node v24.15.0, `npm run bench` (commit
introducing this section: see PR #68):

| kind | N | mixed hit rate | mixed median (µs/call) | miss median (µs/call) |
|------|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| circles | 1 000 | 1.5% | 2.1 | 2.1 |
| circles | 10 000 | 16.0% | 19.1 | 19.2 |
| circles | 50 000 | 60.4% | 75–77 | 96–97 |
| circles | 200 000 | 97.4% | 73–77 | **380** |
| segments | 1 000 | 2.7% | 29.4 | 28.1 |
| segments | 10 000 | 25.1% | 294 | 294 |
| polyline | 1 000 | 0.0% | 28.5 | 29.0 |
| polyline | 10 000 | 0.7% | 284 | 289 |
| rects | 1 000 | 0.4% | 2.1 | 2.1 |
| rects | 10 000 | 5.8% | 19.9 | 19.7 |
| grid, 100×100 cells (202 edges) | — | 100% | 0.5 | 0.1 |
| grid, 1000×1000 cells (2002 edges) | — | 100% | 0.3 | 0.1 |

`circles`/`rects` **mixed** numbers look sub-linear from 50k→200k because the hit rate climbs
from 60% to 97% at fixed canvas size — that's early-return doing its job on *this benchmark's*
density, not evidence hit-test itself is sub-linear. The **miss** column is the true O(n) scan
cost and the number to read as the worst case: at 200k circles, one guaranteed-miss `hitTest`
call costs **~0.38 ms**. `segments`/`polyline` have no early exit (every query walks the full
element list to find the nearest segment) and scale linearly with N regardless of hit rate, ~10×
per decade as expected for O(n). `grid`'s binary search stays sub-microsecond even at 1000 edges
per axis (2000 comparisons/hover under the old linear scan, ~11 under the new binary search) —
not literally O(1) as an earlier draft of this section and `roadmap.md` said, but fast enough that
the distinction is invisible at these sizes.

**Conclusion: even at 200 000 circles (worst-case miss) or 10 000 segments, one `hitTest` call
costs well under 0.5 ms — three orders of magnitude below the render floor (tens of ms) and
manifest-transfer cost (hundreds of ms at the multi-MB extreme, see the stress test above).**
This confirms, with a direct hit-test measurement rather than an inference from render time, that
a spatial index (quadtree/grid bucketing) is not justified by the data: the wall a user would
actually feel is still payload size, not hit-test CPU. `docs/dev/roadmap.md`'s spatial-
acceleration lines cite this section rather than restating these numbers.

## MsgPack fast-path (Q5 sub-claim)

`published_to_js` always serializes via **MsgPack** (not JSON) — confirmed by the format Pluto
uses for published objects. The *TypedArray binary fast-path* (the Q5 "MsgPack fast-path") only
kicks in for top-level typed numeric vectors (`Vector{UInt8}`/`Vector{Float64}`…). **Our manifest
root is `Dict{String,Any}` with `Any[]` layers**, so the bulk serializes as generic MsgPack
maps/arrays, *not* binary blobs — even though leaf geometry is `Vector{Float32}`, it's nested
inside `Any` containers. Practical impact is small at normal sizes, but at the multi-MB extreme
(scatter-200k → 9.3 MB, heatmap-1000² → 4.78 MB) the generic-map serialization is exactly the
~290 ms non-render cost the stress round-trip exposed. **But the fix is *not* the fast-path** — the
encoding experiment above measured that engaging it (lifting geometry to a top-level typed vector)
buys only ~5% over plain int-pixel quantization, which already gets 58% *inside* the current
`Dict/Any` structure. So the manifest-shape rewrite is rejected; int-pixel coords + capping
`values[]` are the committed wins.

## Not measured (deliberately deferred)

- **Editor-lag knee** — the actual point where the Pluto *editor* (not the kernel) stutters from
  large cell output. Our payloads sit at/just above the anecdotal band; the only way to pin the
  real knee is to load increasingly heavy cells in a live notebook and watch the editor. Cheap
  follow-up if MB-scale features (animation) get built. (The round-trip *latency* — distinct from
  editor stutter — is now measured above.)

Payload size, the thing that drives every cost here, is now known — and the live round-trip
confirms render time, not the browser, is the latency bottleneck.

### The payload terms

A rendered `:webgl` cell ships three payloads over Pluto's `published_to_js` (MsgPack on the wire);
the click *return* value (`{layer,index,payload}`) is tiny and not a factor:

| Term | Carried by | Cost driver | Shipped |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **WGLMakie bundle** | `published_to_js` → blob URL → `import()` | fixed (vendored bundle + three.js + atlas) | **once per notebook** (M2) |
| **scene** | `published_to_js` (MsgPack binary) | #plots × geometry + glyph atlas | every render (per cell / per frame) |
| **manifest + overlay** | reuses Masque core verbatim | #hit-elements | every render (tiny — see the `:cairo` envelope above) |

The **bundle dominated** and is now shared once per notebook (M2 / PR #18), so the per-cell cost is
just the **scene**.

### Envelope (2026-06-30, WGLMakie 0.13.12)

| | shipped | wire | gzip-bin | gzip-json | JSON proxy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WGLMakie bundle | once per notebook | **1.09 MB** | — | — | — |
| scene — 2D lines (200 pts) | per cell | **0.07 MB** | 0.02 | 0.05 | 0.33 |
| scene — 2D scatter + text (40) | per cell | **0.10 MB** | 0.03 | 0.08 | 0.44 |
| scene — 3D helix (300 pts) | per cell | **0.14 MB** | 0.05 | 0.11 | 0.56 |

So the first `:webgl` cell ships ~1.1 MB (bundle) + ~0.07–0.14 MB (scene); each **additional** cell —
and each tier-1 reactive re-render — ships just its **0.07–0.14 MB** scene. That's **≈8–16×** below
the 1.09 MB bundle.

#### Stress + server cost (the terms the head-to-head turns on)

Two `:webgl` facts under stress (measured **2026-06-30 by `bench/vs_cairo.jl`**, `Random.seed!(0)` —
sizes exact, ms wall-clock/approximate; units MB = bytes/1 000 000):

| scene | wire | serialize ms |
|---|---|---|
| scatter 100 000 | 0.86 MB | ~30 |
| heatmap 200² | 1.96 MB | ~30 |
| heatmap 500² | 11.8 MB | ~45 |

- **Serialize time is ~flat (~30 ms) regardless of N** — `scene_payload` only *serializes*; the GPU
  draw is offloaded to the client. Contrast `:cairo`, which rasterizes server-side: `bench/vs_cairo.jl`
  measures its render+encode climbing to **~2.3 s at 100k points** (`markersize=6`, matching this
  file's own `bench/payload_envelope.jl`). `bench/stress.jl` sweeps 100k too but at `markersize=4`,
  where it records **~1.6 s** (the "manifest is the high-N wall" table above) — the marker size
  drives the raster cost, so the two are consistent, not contradictory. This flat WebGL line is the
  per-update UX win, not a measurement gap.
- **Dense rasters blow up the scene**: a heatmap ships as a value grid, so 500² = 11.8 MB vs a ~1 MB
  Cairo PNG. `:webgl` is *not* universally lighter — rasters are Cairo's home turf.

**Cross-backend comparison (wire + UX + cost regimes):** see
[`backend-comparison.md`](backend-comparison.md), generated by `bench/vs_cairo.jl` — the head-to-head,
the crossover-N analysis, and the interaction matrix (view manipulation is planned as
backend-symmetric `@bind` re-render; only the client-side GPU camera is out of scope — see
`backend-comparison.md` §1†/§6, not restated here). It reconciles with this section and the
`:cairo` envelope above.

#### Wire vs JSON proxy

`published_to_js` does **not** ship the scene as JSON text. Pluto's MsgPack encodes every typed
numeric `Vector` (`Float32`/`Int32`/`UInt32`/`UInt8` — exactly what `_plain` emits) as a **binary**
extension (`reinterpret(UInt8, x)`, `sizeof·length`). So the real wire is the **binary** column,
**~4–5× under** `JSON3.write` (floats-as-text) — the proxy an earlier bench reported. The committed
bench reports both; the `wire` column is what actually crosses the wire (dominant term; structural
map/string overhead adds a little).

### Bundle sharing — why it's once per notebook (M2 / PR #18)

`published_to_js` ids are content-addressed (`notebook_id/objectid(x)`, and `objectid(::String)` is
content-based), so the one `Ref`-cached bundle string has a **stable id** that crosses the wire
exactly once: across cells, Pluto's notebook merge keeps one copy on load; across re-runs of a cell,
Pluto nulls already-known ids before sending (`known_published_objects` + `format_output.jl`), so a
re-run re-ships only its new-id scene, never the stable-id bundle. The browser then caches the
bundle/shim blob URLs once on `window.__MasqueWGL` so the WGLMakie module imports once, not per cell.

### Deferred compression levers (measured, not yet built)

The per-cell scene is already small (binary), so compression is **deferred** — both levers measured:

- **gzip.** The bench's `gzip-bin` column measures gzip-of-binary at **~3×** (0.07→0.02 MB), but to
  use it we'd have to bypass `published_to_js`'s object channel and hand-roll a **msgpack decoder in
  JS**. The cheap path — gzip-of-JSON via the browser's native `DecompressionStream` → `JSON.parse`
  (the `gzip-json` column) — buys only **~25%** vs the current wire, since it starts from float-text.
  Not worth a new JS decoder + failure surface for ~0.05 MB/cell yet.
- **Atlas sharing.** The glyph-atlas tiles (`glyph_data/atlas_updates/<hash>`) carry content hashes
  **observed to repeat across scenes** (the digit/label tiles recur in all three bench figures above),
  so they're shareable like the bundle — but each is ~10–20 KB, gzip overlaps the win, and hoisting
  them to a shared channel is real complexity.

**Revisit both only if tier-1 animation profiling (per-frame scene re-ship) shows the scene is the
bottleneck** — tier-2 in-place patching (`roadmap.md`) already ships no new scene at all.

## Axis3 projection hinge spike (2026-07-01)

Not a size/latency number, but recorded here under the same single-source rule (one committed
home for a measured figure; other docs cite, never restate — `spike/` itself is gitignored).

**Result: build-time `Makie.project(ax.scene, Point3f)` lands on the rendered CairoMakie `Axis3`
raster with 0.0 px deviation** — measured on a static camera *and* again after an
`azimuth`/`elevation` change, projecting the scatter's data points through the corrected shared
projection closure (post-PR #32, `transform_func` applied) and comparing against the rendered
marker positions in the raster. `Point2f(x, y)` ≡ `Point3f(x, y, 0)` is byte-identical through
the same closure, so widening the geometry path to 3D cannot regress 2D. This is the WS-3D
"projection hinge" gate — cleared. Cited by `architecture.md`, `backend-comparison.md`, and
`roadmap.md`.

**`:webgl` canvas half (2026-07-02, WS-3D core landing): 0.0 px.** The mirror check on the live
canvas: render the E2E `page3d.html` (Axis3 scatter, red markers, explicit azimuth/elevation) in
GL-capable headless Chromium (SwiftShader), screenshot the `<canvas>`, and probe the pixel at
every build-time projected marker center — **each center pixel is a rendered marker pixel**
(nearest red at 0.0 px for all three markers; blank-canvas guarded so GL-init failure can't pass
vacuously). This was the "WGL canvas-alignment spike" gating the `:webgl` half of Axis3 parity —
cleared. The one semantic the 2D WGL alignment spike hadn't exercised (`viewport` origin/ppu/
y-flip on an `Axis3` canvas) is exactly what this measures. Bond-level coverage is committed CI:
`test/e2e` clicks the Axis3 page's marker 0 and asserts the `{index,x,y,z}` payload through
`transform_value`.

## WGL context lifecycle — the "context leak" premise, measured (2026-07-02)

> Measured at **PR #37** (branch base `8cc47cc`, the WS-3D core merge),
> **WGLMakie 0.13.12** (vendored bundle), Julia 1.12, headless Chromium (Playwright).

**Result: `:webgl` cell re-renders do NOT leak GL contexts.** Method: a live Pluto kernel
(headless Chromium), a `@bind` PlutoUI slider driving `azimuth` into `masque(fig)` (each step =
a full kernel re-render of the widget), `HTMLCanvasElement.getContext` instrumented before any
page script to count context creations and `webglcontextlost` events. Five-step sweep:

| after step | created | lost | **live** |
|---|---|---|---|
| mount | 1 | 0 | **1** |
| 1–5 (each) | +1 | +1 | **1** |
| total | 6 | 5 | **1** |

Mechanism (WGLMakie 0.13, vendored bundle): `check_screen`, called from `render_scene` on every
animation frame, disposes any screen whose canvas is no longer in the document
(`renderer.forceContextLoss()` + full dispose; console: "removing WGL context, canvas is not in
the DOM anymore!"). Pluto replaces the cell output on re-run, the old canvas detaches, and the
context is reclaimed within one frame. Cell **delete** detaches the canvas identically, so the
same mechanism covers it — the once-planned re-run-vs-delete lifecycle distinction is moot.
(Scope, honestly: the sweep *measures* the re-run half; the delete half is inferred from the
shared DOM-detach mechanism. `ctx_growth.mjs` attempts to measure delete too — it drives
Pluto's delete-cell control when reachable and asserts live→0 — but Pluto 0.20's delete UI is
not a directly-clickable button, so runs report `delete_measured=false` and the inference
stands until Pluto's UI or the tool's drive changes.)

**What this kills and what it keeps.** The earlier claim ("naive re-mounting leaks WebGL
contexts toward the browser's ~16 cap; all `:webgl` view-manip is gated on unbuilt context
reuse") was reasoned-not-measured, and is **false** on the shipped stack. `:webgl` sliders work
today (the sweep round-tripped the bond on every step). What survives as fact: each re-render
pays context + scene re-initialization — a per-step *cost*, for which the **camera-only
resident-scene patch** (ship only the new camera + freshly projected overlay to the still-live
scene) is the candidate optimization, but it is gated on canvas identity, not payload size:
Pluto destroys the `<canvas>` on every cell replacement (#86; `roadmap.md` §"View manipulation
and the remount").

**Reproduce**: `test/e2e/ctxgrowth_notebook.jl` + `test/e2e/ctx_growth.mjs` (local tools, same
serve.jl harness as the through-Pluto E2E; not in CI — a through-Pluto job is the flake-prone
kind, and the property is upstream-owned). Re-run on a WGLMakie major bump: if upstream ever
drops the `check_screen` disposal, this is the measurement that notices.
