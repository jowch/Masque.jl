Two contracts cross between layers, and only two: **`InteractionContext`** (backend → interactable)
and **`HitLayer`** (interactable → manifest/JS). Everything else is private to a layer.

## 2. The backend seam — `AbstractBackend`

The backend owns exactly two operations: *produce the displayable artifact*, and *project
data→pixels* for that artifact. Everything CairoMakie-specific lives behind it; nothing
upstream of it knows what rendered the image.

```julia
abstract type AbstractBackend end

render(::AbstractBackend, fig)::RenderResult         # finalize layout + produce artifact
context(::AbstractBackend, fig)::InteractionContext  # projection + per-axis transforms

struct RenderResult
    mime    :: String                                 # "image/png" | "image/svg+xml"
    payload :: Union{Vector{UInt8}, String}           # bytes (raster) | text (svg)
    width   :: Int                                    # output image px
    height  :: Int
    scaling :: Float64                                # device_scaling_factor (px_per_unit for PNG)
end
```

**`CairoBackend` was the only v1 implementation.** (Update: a second, co-equal implementation,
`WebGLBackend` — the `:webgl` backend, in `ext/MasqueWGLMakieExt.jl` — was added later; see the
note at the end of this section.) `CairoBackend` renders PNG only — no vector/SVG output path
exists (a `CairoBackend(vector=true)` groundwork field was removed pre-registration as dead code;
see `roadmap.md`'s SVG output path item for what an actual implementation would need). `render` =
`colorbuffer` → PNG → bytes. `context` calls
`Makie.update_state_before_display!(fig)` (mandatory, validated) then builds the projection closure
and reads each axis's transform.

**Don't corrupt the user's figure.** Makie `Figure`s can't be `deepcopy`'d (they hold module refs),
so instead the one mutation we introduce — forcing an opaque background — is **saved and restored**
(try/finally). `update_state_before_display!` is also run, but that's exactly the step Makie performs
at display/save time, so it's benign, not corruption. See also the DPI/sizing policy in `frontend-delivery.md`
(render at `2 × (max_width or 700px column)`, opaque background, package-owned wide mode).

The seam was originally scoped static-only: v1's research (Q0) found a browser-side *live*
WGLMakie rendering model server-centric and reload-fragile, at odds with the static/durable
output this project set out to provide, and framed it as a different product rather than a
deferred target. **Update:** the seam turned out to admit a live implementation cleanly after
all — `WebGLBackend` implements the same `AbstractBackend` contract (`render`/`context`)
against a browser-GPU `<canvas>` instead of a PNG, shipped as the `MasqueWGLMakieExt` weak-dep
extension. The two backends are now co-equal peers (`_resolve_backend` in `src/render.jl`
picks the loaded one, honors `backend=`, and defaults to Cairo if both are present); see
`backend-comparison.md` for the cost/regime tradeoff (the interaction
feature set is identical on both — parity is CI-enforced by the golden-manifest harness). The seam
still also admits a future GLMakie-static backend (GPU offscreen → PNG, same contract) or a
pure-image backend.

### `InteractionContext` — the backend → interactable bridge

The context is **backend-produced** so projection is not hard-wired to `Makie.project`. It carries a
projection closure (backend's implementation of data→image-px) plus the per-axis transforms (which are
*also* serialized to JS for continuous inversion).

```julia
struct InteractionContext
    project    :: Function                        # (ax, point::Point2) -> Point2f in image px
    transforms :: Dict{Symbol, AxisTransform}     # one per axis; keyed by an axis id
    width      :: Int
    height     :: Int
    scaling    :: Float64
end

# the ONE coordinate primitive interactables call — never re-derive projection
data_to_image_px(ctx::InteractionContext, ax, p) = ctx.project(ax, p)

struct AxisTransform
    id        :: Symbol
    xlims     :: Tuple{Float64,Float64}
    ylims     :: Tuple{Float64,Float64}
    xscale    :: Symbol                            # :identity | :log10 | :log | :symlog10 | :pseudolog10
    yscale    :: Symbol
    viewport  :: NTuple{4,Float64}                 # (x, y, w, h) in image px, top-left origin
    xreversed :: Bool
    yreversed :: Bool
    xcats     :: Union{Nothing, Vector{String}}    # categorical tick map (v1)
    ycats     :: Union{Nothing, Vector{String}}
    valueaxis :: Union{Nothing, Symbol}            # nothing = 2-D {x,y} readout; :x/:y = 1-D colorbar readout
end
```

For CairoMakie the projection closure is the validated spike math:
`q = Makie.project(ax.scene, p); ((q+origin)·scaling) with y-flipped to image coords`.
The `AxisTransform` is the *same information* expressed declaratively, so JS can invert pixels→data
for `AxisInteractable` and for live hover-coordinate readout (the drag/Tier-0 enabler).

**Categorical axes are v1.** When an axis uses a categorical conversion, `xcats`/`ycats` carry the
ordered tick labels so JS maps a pixel to the right category (and tooltips/readout show the category,
not the integer index). Without this, bars/boxplots on categorical axes would report wrong coordinates —
so it's shipped, not stubbed.

**Colorbar `AxisTransform` and the figure-block walk (M3).** Colorbar blocks live in `fig.content`,
not in any `Axis` scene, so `context()` runs a second walk over `fig.content` after collecting axes —
picking up every `Makie.Colorbar` and registering it under a `Symbol("cb", k)` id. Each colorbar gets
its own `AxisTransform`: the value scale (`limits[]`, `scale[]`) is mapped to the long axis (`ylims` for
vertical, `xlims` for horizontal), and `valueaxis` is set to `:y` or `:x` accordingly. The viewport is
the colorbar's laid-out pixel bbox (`computedbbox[]`), converted with the same ×scaling + y-flip used for
axes. JS reads `valueaxis` to invert the cursor pixel to a scalar payload `(; value)` — the same
`invertAxis` path `AxisInteractable` uses for its 2-D `{x,y}` readout, projected along one axis only.

## 3. The interactable seam — `AbstractInteractable`

Every interactable — built-in or user-authored — implements one contract. The framework never
special-cases built-ins; `PointInteractable` is simply the first public implementation.

```julia
abstract type AbstractInteractable end

# REQUIRED: compact, image-px hit geometry. Usually one layer; composites (ScatterLines) return more.
hitlayers(i::AbstractInteractable, ctx::InteractionContext)::Vector{HitLayer}

# OPTIONAL (defaulted):
validate(::AbstractInteractable, ::InteractionContext)::Union{Nothing,String} = nothing   # fail loud
events(::AbstractInteractable)::Tuple = (:click, :hover)   # which events the overlay wires
# tooltip content is per-LAYER, set via the `tooltip` kwarg on each interactable
# constructor (nothing → auto-table, Markup → template, false → suppress).
# The per-element `tooltip(interactable, idx, payload)` dispatch is retired (M2.3).
# See §10 Tooltips, below.
# hoverstyle is per-LAYER too — the manifest ships one `style` per layer, not per element.
# stroke=nothing (default) omits "stroke" from the manifest; the overlay then draws its own
# split highlight — a color-dodge fill (brightens) plus a multiply/screen edge stroke (darkens
# on light/dark figures) — instead of a stroke colour. `colors` no longer feeds the highlight,
# only the tooltip accent. An explicit stroke here is used verbatim (no blend, single element).
hoverstyle(::AbstractInteractable)::NamedTuple = (; stroke=nothing, width=2)
```

**`validate` is per-capability, not a global scale gate** (fixes a latent silent-coordinate bug).
Element interactables (Point/Segment/Rect/Polygon) are projected **in Julia** via `Makie.project`,
so they impose **no axis-scale restriction** — they work on any scale Makie can project (linear, log,
symlog, …). Only `AxisInteractable` and `ColorbarInteractable` rely on **client-side** pixel→data
inversion, so they alone restrict to scales the JS `invert` implements (identity, log10/log, +
categorical via the shipped category map). A blanket `_OK_SCALES` gate would be both too strict
(rejecting element types that work) and too loose (passing `AxisInteractable` on a scale the JS
inverts wrong). Default `validate` stays permissive; `AxisInteractable.validate` and
`ColorbarInteractable.validate` are the ones that gate.

### `HitLayer` — the serialized unit (per interactable, per kind)

The unit is a **layer**, not a single element, because two v1 surfaces need compact *geometry*
that a flat per-element list can't give: a 1000×1000 **heatmap grid** (ship edges, not 10⁶ rects) and
a **polyline** (ship vertices once, hit-test segments in JS). A layer is one geometry *kind* plus the
data to resolve a hit to an element index and its payload.

> **Caveat (the grid is compact in geometry, not in payload).** The grid *geometry* is O(edges),
> but to power the client-side `(i,j)=value` readout the layer also ships the full **source-resolution**
> `values[]` matrix — O(source-cells), the dominant grid term. So a routine 2000²–4000² `heatmap!`/`image!`
> ships tens of MB of values on top of a display-bounded PNG (4.78 MB measured at 1000²). This is the
> day-one-reachable face of "the manifest is the scaling wall" (§8). The committed fix ships `values[]`
> only when cells are targetable (≥~1 px on the known display) — sub-pixel grids drop it (§8).

```julia
struct HitLayer
    id       :: Symbol            # stable key for this layer (links to events/style)
    kind     :: Symbol            # :circles | :polyline | :segments | :rects | :grid | :polygons | :axis
    geometry :: Any               # compact, image-px; layout keyed by `kind` (see below)
    payloads :: Vector{Any}       # element index -> JSON-serializable payload (the linkage key)
    axis     :: Symbol            # which AxisTransform applies (for data-coord tooltips / inversion)
    events   :: Tuple             # copied from the interactable
    label    :: Union{Nothing,String}  # optional screen-reader announcement prefix (keyboard nav, §11)
    colors   :: Any                # optional per-element tooltip accent (§10.4)
    links    :: Union{Nothing,Vector{Vector{Symbol}}}  # optional per-element cross-layer highlight (LegendInteractable, M3)
end
```

Geometry layout by `kind` (all coords image-px, top-left origin):

| kind | geometry | JS hit-test | element index |
|---|---|---|---|
| `:circles` | `Float32[cx,cy,r, …]` | distance ≤ r | triple index |
| `:polyline` | `Float32[x,y, …]` (NaN = gap) | nearest segment, dist ≤ tol | segment i = (v[i],v[i+1]) |
| `:segments` | `Float32[x0,y0,x1,y1, …]` | nearest of disjoint pairs | pair index |
| `:rects` | `Float32[cx,cy,w,h, …]` | point-in-rect | quad index |
| `:grid` | `(xedges, yedges, ncols, nrows, values[])` image-px | binary-search bin → (i,j) | `j*ncols+i` (O(1) hit-test; manifest **O(source-cells)** via `values[]`, see §8) |
| `:polygons` | `Vector{Vector{Float32}}` rings | even-odd point-in-polygon | ring index |
| `:axis` | `nothing` (unbounded, `AxisInteractable`) or `Real[x,y,w,h]` bbox (bounded, `ColorbarInteractable`) | absent geometry = always-hit; bbox present = point-in-bbox; invert pixel via `AxisTransform` | `-1` (continuous); `valueaxis ≠ nothing` → 1-D `(; value)` |

`:polyline`/`:segments`' `tol` (the hit-test slack above) is an optional per-layer manifest
field, `"tol"` (image px) — present only when `hit_tol(i) !== nothing` (`SegmentInteractable`
sets it from its `tol` keyword, scaled like `radius`); absent, the overlay falls back to its
own fixed `SEG_TOL`. Every other kind's manifest is untouched by this field.

`label` (optional, per-layer, `String`) is a screen-reader announcement prefix for the
keyboard-navigation overlay (§11) — e.g. `"Scatter"` in "Scatter, element 3 of 10: …". Set via
the `label` keyword on `PointInteractable`/`SegmentInteractable`/`RectInteractable`
(list form)/`PolygonInteractable` (the kinds keyboard nav visits); absent by default, and
omitted from the manifest entirely when unset (same idiom as `selects`/`tol` above) — see
`perf-findings.md` for the measured per-layer wire cost.

This is a **closed set of six geometry kinds** (`:circles/:polyline/:segments/:rects/:grid/:polygons`)
plus the `:axis` continuous channel. The survey confirmed every retained Makie surface projects to one
of them; nothing in v1+v2 needs a seventh. (Text labels — the surface once speculated to need a new
`bbox`/degenerate-polygon primitive — turned out not to: `TextInteractable` rides plain `:rects`, with
a rotated label's box simply expanded to stay axis-aligned; see §3. That premise is retired for text.)

### Built-in interactables (v1 + M3 + Phase 2 text labels)

Five v1 types plus `ColorbarInteractable` (M3) and `TextInteractable` (Phase 2 text labels), one
per hit primitive (`:axis` shared by two; `TextInteractable` reuses `:rects`, no new primitive):

| Type | kind(s) | Makie surfaces | payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PointInteractable` | `:circles` | Scatter, Stem, Spy, ScatterLines·pts | `(; index, x, y)` |
| `SegmentInteractable` | `:polyline` \| `:segments` | Lines, Stairs, ScatterLines·lines (polyline); LineSegments, Errorbars, Rangebars, HLines, VLines (pairs) | `(; segment_index, p0, p1)` |
| `RectInteractable` | `:rects` \| `:grid` | BarPlot, Hist, Waterfall, CrossBar, HSpan, VSpan (list); Heatmap, Image (grid) | grid `(; i, j, value)`; BarPlot/Waterfall `(; low, high, value)`; Hist `(; value, low, high)`; CrossBar `(; midpoint, low, high)`; HSpan/VSpan `(; low, high)` |
| `PolygonInteractable` | `:polygons` | Poly, Band, Pie, Density, Contourf, Violin, Voronoiplot | Band/Density/Voronoiplot `(; index)`; Contourf `(; low, high)`; Violin `(; x)` |
| `AxisInteractable` | `:axis` (unbounded) | the Axis area itself (linear + log) | `(; x, y)` inverted client-side |
| `ColorbarInteractable` *(M3)* | `:axis` (bounded bbox) | Colorbar — auto-extracted from `fig.content` | `(; value)` inverted client-side via `AxisTransform.valueaxis` |
| `LegendInteractable` *(M3)* | `:rects` | Legend — auto-extracted from `fig.content` | `(; label, group, targets)` — `targets` also ships as `HitLayer.links` |
| `TextInteractable` *(Phase 2 text labels)* | `:rects` | Text, Annotation (via `_descendant(p, Makie.Text)`) — data-space only | `(; text, index, x, y)` |

`SegmentInteractable` carries `mode ∈ {:polyline,:pairs}`; `RectInteractable` carries
`layout ∈ {:grid,:list}`. Same JS test, different Julia extractor.

**Text labels as click-to-pick buttons.** `TextInteractable` geometry comes from Makie's own
`Makie.string_boundingboxes(p)` — scene-local pixel space, y-up, bottom-left origin — converted
*directly* to image px (the same ×scaling + y-flip as `project`, but no `project` call: the boxes
are already pixel-space, not data-space, so there is nothing to project). A rotated label still
yields exactly one `:rects` box, expanded to stay axis-aligned (a looser hit target, not a new
geometry kind). The payload's `text`/`index` are the string and its 0-based per-label index;
`x`/`y` are the DATA-space anchor (`positions`), not the pixel box — consistent with `PointInteractable`'s
`(; index, x, y)` shape. `masque(fig)` auto-detects `text!` directly and `annotation!` by reaching
through to its child `Makie.Text` plot (`_descendant`); only **data-space** text is auto-detected
(`space === :data`) — pixel/relative-space text (decorative overlays) is skipped with a warning, not
silently dropped. `TextLabel` (a `Makie.Block`, not a plot) is **not** covered — it needs the
figure-block walk `ColorbarInteractable` uses, not the plot-scene walk — and remains deferred (see
`roadmap.md`).

**Bar payload schema (Phase 2a).** All `:rects`-list bar/span surfaces (BarPlot, Waterfall,
Hist, CrossBar, HSpan, VSpan) use a shared semantic payload — `InteractionEvent.index` carries the element index, so payloads contain only
domain values (no redundant `index` field). **Span viewport-clamp:** HSpan/VSpan hit-rects are
clipped to the owning axis's pixel viewport so a span cannot bleed into a neighboring axis in a
multi-axis figure. **Uniform payload-length validation:** `SegmentInteractable`,
`RectInteractable`, and `PolygonInteractable` all call `_check_payloads` at construction;
a `payloads=` vector of the wrong length throws `ArgumentError` immediately (fail-loud, same
guarantee as `PointInteractable` / `RegionInteractable`).

**Polygon payload schema (Phase 2b).** The six auto-extracted polygon surfaces each carry a
surface-specific semantic payload. Band, Density, and Voronoiplot use `(; index)` — the element
index is already carried by `InteractionEvent.index`, so the payload holds only the domain key.
Contourf carries `(; low, high)` — the data-value bounds of the filled contour level, read from
Makie's computed level range. Violin carries `(; x)` — the category position. BoxPlot's box body
is auto-extracted as `:rects` (un-notched) / `:polygons` (notched) with `(; q1, median, q3)`
drawn from Makie's computed-stats node. **Principle:** hit geometry comes from rendered shapes
(the actual plotted polygons or rects after Makie lays them out); payload values come from
Makie's computed values (not the raw input data).

**Declaration is the contract; plot-introspection is v2 sugar.** v1 constructors take explicit
data-space geometry (`PointInteractable(ax, points; payloads)`), which the survey confirmed is the
robust path — extracting geometry from live `Scatter`/`Heatmap`/`BarPlot` objects is the genuinely
hard part (markersize units, endpoint half-steps, dodge/stack math) and is deferred. A future
`PointInteractable(scatterplot)` will produce the *same* struct, not a different code path.

**Composites emit multiple layers.** `ScatterLines` → one `:circles` layer + one `:polyline` layer,
hit-tested points-first (within marker radius) then segment. This is the model for any composite recipe.

## 4. Custom interactions — same infra, three ergonomic tiers

The convergent lesson from Bokeh / Plotly / Vega-Lite / Observable Plot: **linkage is payload-based,
and the user should never write JavaScript.** A user's custom interaction must produce `HitLayer`s like
everything else. Three tiers, increasing power, zero escape hatches:

**Tier A — declarative regions (the 80% case, no struct).** State *what* is interactable in data space
+ payloads; the framework owns *how it reacts*. This is the Vega-Lite "interaction is just another
mark" analog.

```julia
RegionInteractable(ax;
    regions  = [(:circle, Point2f(x,y), r), (:rect, p, w, h), (:polygon, ring)],
    payloads = [pl1, pl2, pl3],          # parallel; one per region (the linkage key)
    tooltip  = masque"$(label)",           # Markup template; nothing → auto-table, false → suppress
    events   = (:click, :hover))
```

**Tier B — closure against live context.** For geometry computed from `ctx` (Makie's
`register_interaction!(f, …)` analog). Still emits `HitLayer`s.

```julia
FunctionInteractable(ax, f; id, events=(:click,:hover))   # f(ctx)::Vector{HitLayer}
```

**Tier C — full struct.** Implement `hitlayers` (+ optional `validate`/`hoverstyle`). A user
struct is *indistinguishable* from a built-in — same manifest path, same overlay, same `@bind`. Tooltip
content comes from the per-layer `Masque.tooltip_spec(interactable)` seam (built-in interactables expose it
as a `tooltip=` constructor kwarg; a custom struct overrides `Masque.tooltip_spec`). The `tooltip_*` kwargs
on `masque()` are styling only. See §10 Tooltips, below. Example:

```julia
struct CityInteractable <: AbstractInteractable
    positions::Vector{Point2f}; names::Vector{String}; radius::Float32
end
function Masque.hitlayers(c::CityInteractable, ctx)
    coords = Float32[]; for p in c.positions
        q = data_to_image_px(ctx, c.ax, p); append!(coords, (q[1], q[2], c.radius*ctx.scaling))
    end
    [HitLayer(:cities, :circles, coords, [(; name=n) for n in c.names], :main, (:click,:hover))]
end
# tooltip content: add a `tooltip` field to CityInteractable and override
# `Masque.tooltip_spec(c::CityInteractable) = c.tooltip` — see §10 Tooltips, below
```

**Linkage = shared payloads through Pluto reactivity.** Two interactables writing the same payload field
into the same `@bind` variable *are* linked brushing — the Pluto reactive graph is our
`ColumnDataSource`. No central mutable selection store is introduced; that's the whole point of the
no-server architecture.

## 5. The bond value

`@bind sel masque(fig, interactables)`:
- `sel === nothing` until the first deliberate click (clicks outside all layers are a no-op — by design).
- On click: `sel = (; layer, index, payload)` (a `Dict` Julia-side). For `AxisInteractable`,
  `index = -1` and `payload = (; x, y)` inverted from the axis transform in JS.
- Hover **never** sets `sel` — it is overlay-local. Only `events` containing `:click` round-trip.

A typed `InteractionEvent` wrapper over the dict is shipped via
`AbstractPlutoDingetjes.Bonds.transform_value`; the raw NamedTuple/Dict is the underlying value.

**M4 selector contract — Design D.** The bond value depends on whether the interactable is a
selector (a `ROIInteractable` with `selects=:layer_id` set) or not:

- **Click interactables and bounds-only `ROIInteractable`** (no `selects` kwarg) return a single
  `InteractionEvent` (or `nothing` before the first interaction) — the v1 single-event contract is
  unchanged. This is a deliberate Design-D decision: the union `single | Vector` is resolved by the
  presence or absence of `selects`, not by a per-event flag.
- **Selector ROIs** (`ROIInteractable(…; selects=:layer_id)`) implement
  `AbstractSelector <: AbstractInteractable` and return `Vector{InteractionEvent}`:
  - **Points (`:circles`) target** → N point events, one per element whose geometry falls
    within the dragged box.
  - **Grid target** (`:grid` kind) → a 1-element vector holding a **region descriptor**
    `(; i0, i1, j0, j1, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)` — 0-based inclusive cell indices plus
    data-space bounds — for server-side aggregate statistics. The browser never needs `values[]`
    for box-selection.
  - **Empty box** → `InteractionEvent[]` (never `nothing`).

**`AbstractSelector`** is the selector sub-interface (`selects(sel)::Symbol` returning the target
layer id; `compatible_kinds(sel)` returning accepted geometry kinds). At manifest-build,
`compatible_kinds` is validated against the target layer's `kind` — an incompatible pairing is a
loud `ArgumentError`. The only new manifest field is `selects` (a string id) on the selector
layer; `targetKind`/`arity` fields were designed but dropped as redundant — the JS reads the
target kind from the looked-up layer, and `transform_value` detects the `{ items: [...] }` JS
return envelope shape to produce the vector (versus the flat `{layer,index,payload}` dict for
single events).

**Selected-state lives in the manifest, not a `previous=` kwarg.** Because the overlay is wiped on
every re-render, a *persistent* "this element is selected" highlight must be re-derived each render.
The mechanism: the bond value flows back into Julia, Julia marks selected indices as a field **on the
manifest** for the next render, and JS draws them highlighted on mount. There is no `previous=selection`
argument (the earlier sketch is dropped) — selection is reconstructed from the bond, carried in the
manifest, and the round-trip stays flicker-free because the *image* doesn't change, only an overlay
flag does.

**In-drag gesture frames never produce a bond value.** A frame shipped to update the view during
an active drag-to-pan or orbit (§12) does not assign `sel` and does not touch this bond at all —
only the final, committed camera/`limits` value on gesture release goes through the ordinary path
above.

## 6. How it composes — the three interaction tiers

This architecture supports exactly the three tiers from the latency analysis, and the interface maps to
them cleanly:

- **Tier 0 (overlay, 60 fps, no Julia):** hover, live coordinate readout, and dragging *overlay*
  geometry. Enabled by shipping `AxisTransform` to JS. `events(i)` with only `:hover` keeps it local.
- **Tier 1 (precomputed):** `hitlayers(i, ctx)` *is* this tier — Julia computes regions once after
  `update_state_before_display!`. Animation = a precomputed frame sequence (a future `frames` slot on
  the manifest; the format is designed not to preclude it). **It is the one payload-unbounded feature**
  (total = frames × per-frame PNG): ~5.5 MB (187 KB × 30) to ~22 MB (× 120) for a typical plot, 100s of MB
  at scale. The `frames` slot must shrink per-frame cost (downscale / fewer frames) before it ships — §8.
- **Tier 2 (round-trip):** `:click` events → `@bind`. Discrete server re-render from new state is in
  scope on **both** backends for the *committed* value — a click, a keyboard commit, a slider- or
  widget-driven view change, or the final camera/`limits` value released at the end of a
  view-manipulation gesture (drag-to-pan, 3D orbit) — each lands through `@bind` exactly as any
  other Tier 2 value, backend-symmetric. What differs is
  **cost**: `:webgl` re-serializes (~flat) while `:cairo` re-rasterizes (scales with the scene) —
  see `backend-comparison.md`. The **in-drag frames** of a view-manipulation gesture are not Tier 2
  traffic at all — they never touch `@bind`, never re-execute a cell, and the two backends
  implement them by completely different mechanisms; see §12 for the contract those frames follow.
  *Per-frame* faithful redraw (smooth-drag-as-a-guarantee) is a shared latency wall on both, not a
  `:cairo`-only exclusion.

**Named tensions (accepted, not bugs):**
1. `AxisInteractable` returns no region geometry — it rides the `:axis` channel as an unbounded
   catch-all. `ColorbarInteractable` (M3) also uses `:axis` but ships a bbox so the hit region is
   bounded to the colorbar's pixel extent. Worth the shared channel: both collapse into the
   `AxisTransform` already shipped, with no new JS primitive.
2. No general z-order/`Consume` model for overlapping custom regions — JS is first-match-wins in
   manifest order. `build_manifest` now imposes one fixed precedence on that order (not a general
   layering model): `LegendInteractable` layers sort first (a legend drawn over plot geometry
   must win the pixels under it, or it's unhoverable — M3 Legend, §"M3 Legend" below), `:view`
   layers sort last (an ordinary drag wins over the catch-all pan/orbit gesture without a
   modifier — resolves the v1 ScatterLines points-over-segments collision too), everything else
   keeps its original relative order. We adopt Makie's `events` *vocabulary* now for
   forward-compat, not its propagation machinery. A general Consume/z-order model for
   user-stacked custom regions stays YAGNI until someone actually needs to control ordering
   between two of their OWN overlapping interactables — the two cases handled by the fixed rule
   above are structural (a legend/view layer's role, not the caller's choice).

## 7. v1 scope

**In:** CairoBackend (PNG; SVG for sparse plots); `PointInteractable`, `SegmentInteractable`,
`RectInteractable` (list + grid), `PolygonInteractable`, `AxisInteractable`; `RegionInteractable` +
`FunctionInteractable`; explicit-geometry constructors; linear + log axes for `AxisInteractable`
(element types: any Makie-projectable scale); **categorical axes** (category map shipped to JS);
**multiple axes / subplots** in one figure with payload-based linked selection; **single-select**;
typed `InteractionEvent` (`transform_value`); **opaque-bg save/restore** (no figure mutation). Hover tooltips +
JS highlight; click → `@bind`. **Hit-testing is naive O(n) per pointer move** with a documented
ceiling (~few-thousand elements/segments); past that, `log()` a notice — no silent degradation. Spatial
acceleration (bucketing/quadtree) is added only if someone hits the wall — but note (§8) the wall that
bites *first* is manifest **payload size** (serialize + transfer), not hit-test CPU, so the
higher-leverage lever is wire encoding (§9), not a quadtree. Spatial acceleration stays YAGNI until a
profile shows JS hit-test *specifically* is the bottleneck.

**M4 (shipped):** `ThresholdInteractable` (draggable threshold line, Tier 0); `ROIInteractable`
(draggable + resizable box, Tier 0 bounds + M4 box-select); `AbstractSelector` /
`selects`-ROI — `Vector{InteractionEvent}` bond, Design-D contract (§5); `ViewInteractable`
(drag-to-pan / drag-to-orbit, commit-on-release); gallery recipes
(box-select scatter, image ROI per-channel stats).

**Phase 2a (shipped):** Hist, Waterfall, CrossBar, HSpan, VSpan — all extracted as `:rects`; shared bar payload schema (semantic, no `index`); span viewport-clamp; uniform `_check_payloads` validation on Segment/Rect/Polygon interactables.

**Phase 2b (shipped):** Band, Density, Contourf, Violin, Voronoiplot — extracted as `:polygons`; surface-specific payloads (Band/Density/Voronoiplot `(; index)`, Contourf `(; low, high)`, Violin `(; x)`). BoxPlot box-body auto-extracted as `:rects` (un-notched) / `:polygons` (notched) with `(; q1, median, q3)`. Tricontourf deferred; BoxPlot whiskers/outliers decorative (box-body-only).

**M3 Colorbar (shipped):** `ColorbarInteractable` — hover/click value readout for any `Colorbar` block, auto-extracted by `masque(fig)` via a figure-block walk over `fig.content`. Rides the `:axis` channel with a bounded bbox geometry; `AxisTransform.valueaxis` tags the value axis so JS inverts the cursor pixel to a scalar `(; value)`.

**M3 Legend (shipped):** `LegendInteractable` — a `Makie.Legend` block's entries as `:rects` hit regions, auto-extracted by the same figure-block walk as Colorbar. Each entry's pixel row is recovered by walking `leg.grid` (GridLayoutBase) for the 2-column shade `Box` Makie's own click-to-toggle hit-tests (`makie_compat.jl`'s `_legend_entries`/`_legend_bbox`); the entry↔plot link comes from `Makie.get_plots` on the entry's elements, the same linkage Makie's built-in legend interaction uses. This introduces `HitLayer`'s only cross-layer field, `links :: Union{Nothing, Vector{Vector{Symbol}}}` — one id-list per element, naming other layers to highlight together with the hovered/selected one (serialized as `"links"`, an array of string-id arrays). `build_manifest` validates every `links` id against the manifest's own layers and their `kind` (must be in `_SELECTED_KINDS`, §5's `selected=` list): an explicit `targets=` failing that check is a build-time `ArgumentError` (the caller's own claim); an auto-resolved (plotmap-derived) one is instead warned and dropped, since silently-unlinkable plots (e.g. a heatmap in the same legend) are a normal, not exceptional, shape. Custom legends (`LineElement`/`MarkerElement`/`PolyElement` built without `plots=`) resolve to empty links — still hittable, no highlight — unless the caller passes `targets=` explicitly.

**Phase 2 text labels (shipped):** `TextInteractable` — `text!` and `annotation!` labels as
click-to-pick buttons, auto-extracted by `masque(fig)` for data-space text. Rides `:rects`; geometry
from `Makie.string_boundingboxes` (no font-metric measurement needed — the originally-speculated
`bbox` primitive was never built). `TextLabel` (a `Block`, needs the figure-block walk rather than
the plot-scene walk) remains deferred.

**v2:** plot-object introspection constructors; ABLines/Arc,
`TextLabel` (Block) support, animation frames, SVG-overlay annotations, spatial hit-test acceleration.

**Backend scope — corrected (2026-07-02), core shipped (WS-3D).** The earlier framing here
("3D … is the `:webgl` backend's domain") was wrong about *why*: CairoMakie renders **static 3D
natively**. The `Axis3` guard has since **lifted**: both backends collect `Axis3` blocks, element
interactables project through the shared closure (3D enters only at the projection step —
spike-verified exact on the Cairo raster *and* on the live `:webgl` canvas, static and
after an `azimuth`/`elevation` change; figures in `perf-findings.md` §"Axis3 projection hinge
spike"), and the `axis3` parity goldens are byte-identical across backends. Continuous pixel→data
inversion is undefined on a 3D axis (a screen pixel is a ray), so `is3d` transforms ship
degenerate lims and `Axis`/`Threshold`/`ROI` interactables fail loud. **`PolarAxis` discrete
overlays ship on both backends** (shared projection applies `Makie.Polar` via `transform_func`;
`ispolar` transforms + the same continuous-consumer gates; Scatter/Lines/LineSegments/
ScatterLines auto-extract). WGL scene JSON scrubs non-finite floats in GPU buffers for
transport only — Masque hit geometry stays Julia-projected. Continuous θ/r readout still needs
the polar transform serialized to JS — deferred. `LScene` remains guarded (own camera/scoping look). The **Masque-wide** non-goals (every backend, by design) are the
**client-side GPU camera** — a JS-driven camera the kernel never hears about, which would desync
the Julia-projected overlay and can only ever exist on one backend — and **GPU-pick occlusion**.
**Occlusion policy (document-and-accept, backend-symmetric):** every projected vertex is
hittable, including far-side points on solid objects — first-match-wins resolves overlaps exactly
as in 2D; the upgrade path is a build-time CPU painter's cull in Julia (NDC depth), symmetric by
construction. `Surface` hit-testing is deferred on both alike (a hit-test-complexity gap —
unbounded per-cell payload + occlusion — not a backend-capability gap);
`MeshScatter`/wireframe/arrows are extracted today, not deferred. High-frequency live redraw is the shared cost wall above,
not a per-backend exclusion. See `backend-comparison.md` and `roadmap.md`.

## 8. Payload scaling & robustness to large inputs

Measured in the Phase 0 spike (`perf-findings.md` is the single source of every number here; cite it,
don't restate). A rendered cell ships **two** payloads — the JS→Julia click return is negligible:

| Term | Carried by | Bounded by |
|---|---|---|
| **base64 PNG** | HTML `<img>` | the **display** (DPI/`max_width` policy → output px), *not* source resolution |
| **manifest** | `published_to_js` (MsgPack) | **unbounded by display** — O(#hit-elements) + O(source-cells) for grids |

**The manifest is the scaling wall** — not the PNG, not render, not hit-test CPU. A realistic single
plot is **50–400 KB total and render-bound** (~65 ms round-trip). High element counts reach multi-MB and
flip to **payload-bound** (~553 ms total measured at a 4.78 MB manifest). Since the `values[]` cap (§8)
keeps even a 1 M-cell heatmap render-bound, the case that reaches this regime by default is now **high-N
scatter** (200k pts → 7.72 MB manifest). Nothing crashes — it degrades into the half-second range — but
tens of MB would lag the Pluto editor.

**M2.3 (tooltip wire format):** shipping per-element tooltip strings as a retired `tooltips[]` array
would have added O(N × string-bytes) — the dominant inflation term at high element counts (see
`perf-findings.md` §"Scope bounds for downstream phases" for the measured upper bounds). M2.3 avoids
this: tooltip content ships as two O(1)-per-layer fields — `template` (pre-parsed segments, present when
`tooltip` is a `Markup`) and a top-level `tipStyle` dict — leaving the per-element envelope unchanged.
See §10 Tooltips, below, for the wire shape and authoring API.

**Robustness to large inputs (assume a user *will* do this) — implemented.** We ship a tool to
Pluto/Makie users, so assume someone overlays `masque` on a 2000²–4000² `heatmap!`/`image!` *because they
can*. The PNG is safe (display-bounded), but the `:grid` `values[]` matrix is **source-bounded**, so that
routine input ships tens of MB of redundant numbers on top of the PNG that already shows them — and the
user's matrix already lives in their Julia session. `values[]` exists only to power the no-round-trip
`(i,j)=value` hover, so it is dropped when the hover can't target a cell:

**The cap criterion: compute the cell's *expected on-screen* size on the fly, and drop `values[]` when it's
sub-pixel.** A Pluto output cell is only so wide — the display is **bounded by the column** (`max_width`,
700 px default), so the on-screen size is known at manifest-build. Everything needed is already in hand:
`display_css = min(scene_width, max_width)` (the column-bounded display width), the axis viewport in image
px (we project the edges anyway), and the output image width. So
`cell_screen_px = (viewport_image_px / ncols) × (display_css / image_width)`. Under today's DPI policy the
PNG is rendered at 2× the display width (`px_per_unit = 2·min(scene, max_width)/scene`), so that ratio is
0.5 and it reduces to `cell_image_px / 2` — but compute the ratio rather than hardcode ÷2, so it tracks the
policy / wide-mode `max_width`. **Ship `values[]` only when `min(cell_screen_px) ≥ τ`** (τ ≈ 1–2 px); below
that the user *cannot* put the cursor over an individual cell, so the per-cell value is useless and is
dropped. This is an *expected* size (it assumes the default column; the overlay still hit-tests against the
true runtime scale via `getBoundingClientRect`, so the estimate only gates ship/drop). Self-tuning: for a
600-wide figure a 50² heatmap is ~12 px/cell (keep), 200² is ~3 px (keep), **1000² is ~0.6 px (drop)**,
2000²–4000² are 0.3–0.15 px (drop) — and it **subsumes the special `Image` case** (images are source-res >
display-res → sub-pixel → auto-dropped), so no separate rule is needed. When dropped, the payload falls back
to `{i,j}` (the click still localizes the region) and a one-time `@warn` fires (fail-loud). Measured size
benefit: 499× smaller at 1000² (`perf-findings.md`). M2.3 owns the `{i,j,value}` payload shape, but the cap
is decoupled and ships independently. *Implemented:* `src/interactables.jl` (`GRID_VALUES_MIN_SCREEN_PX`,
the `:grid` hitlayer) gated on `InteractionContext.display_scale` (= `display_css / image_width`, set in
`context()`); the overlay tolerates an absent `values[]` (hover shows `(i,j)` only).

## 9. Wire encoding & precision

`published_to_js` serializes the manifest as **generic MsgPack** maps/arrays (the `Dict{String,Any}` /
`Any[]` root defeats the TypedArray binary fast-path even though leaf vectors are numeric). The
encoding levers were **de-speculated by a measurement experiment** (`bench/encoding_experiment.jl` →
`perf-findings.md`), which changed the verdict from my first design guess:

- **Scalar precision — int-pixel quantization (the win, implemented).** Geometry was `Float32` *pixel*
  coordinates, overkill for ~1px hit-testing. Rounding coords to `Int` measured **58% off the geometry
  term** (5.00 → 2.10 B/coord; 732 → 307 KB at 50k circles) — and it needs **no structural change**:
  MsgPack already encodes small ints in 1–3 bytes, the frontend reads numbers either way, and ≤0.5px
  rounding is inside the hit-test tolerance. *Implemented:* `src/interactables.jl` builds per-element
  geometry vectors as `Int` via `_q(x) = round(Int, x)` (circles/segments/rects/polygons/regions + grid
  edges); on a whole realistic manifest the saving is ~17 % (geometry is one term among the payload's
  Float64 `x`/`y`). `Float16` is *not* the way down: MsgPack has no float16 (it promotes to float32 → no
  saving) and is lossy above 2048px.
- **Container structure — typed-array fast-path (rejected by the experiment).** Lifting geometry to a
  top-level typed numeric vector to engage the binary fast-path measured only **~5% beyond int-quantization**
  (2.00 vs 2.10 B/coord) — because compact ints already sit near the 2-byte binary floor. The structural
  manifest-shape change is **not worth 5%**; dropped. (It would only pay off if we kept *floats*, 5→4 B,
  which int-quantization already beats.)
- **The precision split (a real constraint).** Per-element **geometry** is quantizable to pixels, but the
  **`AxisTransform` lims/viewport must stay `Float64`**: the M4 drag path inverts pixel→data through them and
  the error amplifies — and at O(1)/axis the precision costs nothing. Only per-element geometry is quantized.

The other manifest term — heatmap/image `values[]` (§8) — is bounded not by encoding but by *not shipping
it*: capping/dropping it measured **499×** smaller (4.78 MB → 9.8 KB at 1000²). Both are now shipped (the
cap in PR #8, int-pixel coords here); they were the committed manifest-payload work — reach for them before
a quadtree (§7).

## 10. Tooltips

The `masque"..."` / `Markup` template system. Tooltips are its first consumer; the mechanism
generalises to any surface that overlays structured content on hover (labels, annotations,
panels). User-facing usage (defaults, `masque"..."` examples, styling kwargs) is on the site's
[Tooltips page](https://jowch.github.io/Masque.jl/dev/tooltips/); this section is the mechanism
and wire contract behind it.

### 10.1 Mental model

Every Masque interactable carries a `payloads` array — one JSON-serialisable value per element,
built at render time in Julia. **The payload is data; the template is layout.** When the user
hovers over an element, the browser reads that element's payload entry and interpolates it
into the template to produce the tooltip HTML — no round-trip to Julia, no live callback.

This is forced by the no-server constraint: a statically-exported Masque widget has no Julia
kernel to call. Any content the tooltip shows must already be in the manifest at render time,
either as a template (O(1) per layer) or as data in the payload (O(N) per element, the same
O(N) the interactable already ships for hit-testing). A per-element callback
(`tooltip = p -> @htl"..."`) would require either a live kernel or pre-calling it for every
element at build time — the former is unavailable offline, the latter collapses into a
per-element string array and is O(N × string-bytes) on the wire. The template approach avoids
both.

### 10.2 The `masque"..."` macro and `Markup` type

`masque"..."` is a string macro (exported; underlying function `@masque_str`) that produces a
`Masque.Markup` value. It is the only way to author a template; there is no
`masque(runtime_string)` form.

`Markup` stores the parsed template as an ordered list of segments: each segment is either a
literal `String` (emitted verbatim as HTML into the tooltip) or a
`Field(name::Symbol, spec::Union{Nothing,String})` (a placeholder resolved in the browser from
the hovered element's payload entry).

`$(field)` **does not read a Julia variable** — it is a placeholder for a browser-side payload
lookup resolved at hover time. `$(field:spec)` formats the value with a
[d3-format](https://d3js.org/d3-format) spec before escaping. There is no Julia-object
interpolation in templates.

The literal portions of `masque"..."` are treated as raw HTML; the author is responsible for
escaping `<` and `&` in literal text (same contract as `@htl`). Because `masque"..."` requires a
string literal, a runtime-computed string must travel as a field inside the payload:
pre-render it into `payloads` and reference it with `$(that_field)`.

### 10.3 Validation

Template validation happens at two distinct points. The **documented boundary** between them
is: *Julia validates structure; the browser validates meaning.*

**Phase 1 — macro-expansion (structural, no payload).** The macro parses the template string
at compile time and catches unbalanced/empty/unclosed `$(...)` delimiters, non-identifier field
names, and structurally-invalid d3-format specs. Errors surface as `TemplateValidationError`
with a caret underline pointing at the offending span, attached to the source file and line of
the `masque"..."` call — the user sees them the instant the cell parses, before `masque()` is ever
called.

**Phase 2 — build-time field check (payload-aware).** When `masque()` / `build_manifest` is
called with a `Markup` tooltip, each template's field names are resolved against the actual
payload keys. A field present in the template but absent from the payload is a build-time
`ArgumentError`, with a "did you mean?" suggestion (Levenshtein edit distance ≤ 2). This check
only runs when the layer's payloads are `NamedTuple`s (the default for the built-in
interactables); for `Dict`-valued or heterogeneous payloads, it's skipped and a missing
`$(field)` renders empty at hover instead. `:grid` (heatmap/image) layers carry no per-element
payload; a template there resolves the synthesised fields `$(i)`, `$(j)`, and `$(value)`, which
are likewise not field-validated at build.

d3-format spec *structure* (the type character and arrangement of flags) is validated in Julia
against d3's canonical grammar; the *meaning* of precision, trim, and sign modifiers is only
resolved by the browser's `format()` — a spec can pass Julia and still format unexpectedly
(check d3-format's behaviour for that type character).

A `@generated` compile-time field check (to catch typos before `build_manifest`, for
concretely-typed `NamedTuple` payloads) is deferred — it's a no-op on `Vector{Any}` /
heterogeneous payloads, so Phase 2 stays the only build-time check for now.

### 10.4 Wire format

Each entry in the manifest `layers` array carries at most one of these two optional fields:

| Field | Wire type | Present when |
|---|---|---|
| `template` | `Segment[]` | `tooltip` is a `Markup` |
| `tooltip` | `false` | suppress requested |
| *(neither present)* | — | auto-table default |

`Segment` is `string \| { f: string, spec?: string }` — a literal run or a field placeholder.
The template is **pre-parsed in Julia** at build time and shipped as structured data; the
browser never re-parses a template string.

The per-element `tooltips[]` string array that pre-M2.3 versions emitted is retired. Tooltip
content is entirely client-side, rendered on hover from the existing `payloads[i]` entry — this
keeps the tooltip wire cost O(1) per layer regardless of element count; the per-element
envelope is unchanged (see `perf-findings.md` §"Scope bounds for downstream phases" for the
measured comparison).

The top-level manifest field `tipStyle` (`Record<string,string>`, optional) is a CSS-var dict
of set `tooltip_*` kwargs, applied once to the shadow host at mount.

The top-level `background` field (CSS colour string; optional on `build_manifest` directly, but
`masque()` always sets it) is the figure's own
background colour (`fig.scene.backgroundcolor[]`) — the tooltip's light/dark theme is derived
from it client-side via CSS relative-colour syntax (`lch(from var(--masque-fig-bg) …)`, with a
static-light/OS-dark `@supports not (…)` fallback for browsers without it), not just OS
`prefers-color-scheme`, so a dark figure on a light Pluto page still gets a dark tooltip. A
per-layer `colors` field (optional; a single CSS string, or a shared palette + one index per
element) drives a 3px accent border in the hovered element's own colour — resolved only for a
`PointInteractable(ax, p::Makie.Scatter)`-derived layer whose colour is resolvable; omitted
(no accent) otherwise. Both are O(1)-per-manifest/per-layer, same cost-model rationale as
`tipStyle` above (see `perf-findings.md`'s figure-background/`colors` reconciliation entry).

`HitLayer` carries `template?: TemplateSegment[]`, `tooltip?: false`, and `colors?: string |
{palette, index}`; `Manifest` carries `tipStyle?: Record<string, string>` and `background?:
string`. See `frontend/src/types.ts`.

### 10.5 Security model

**Template markup is author-trusted.** The literal HTML in `masque"..."` is inserted as
`innerHTML` without sanitisation. The author who writes a Pluto notebook already has arbitrary
Julia code execution, so sanitising their own template structure is theater (and a
sanitisation library such as DOMPurify adds ~8–15 KB gzip for no real benefit in this context).
A `<script>` tag in a literal template segment executes — expected for authors who
intentionally embed scripts in their tooltips.

**Interpolated data is escaped by default.** Every value resolved from `$(field)` and every
cell in the auto-table is HTML-escaped with the OWASP five-character set (`& < > " '`) before
insertion.

**URL-context caveat.** HTML escaping does not neutralise scheme injection. If `$(x)` is used
as a *whole* `href` or `src` attribute value and the data contains a `javascript:` URL, the
scheme survives escaping and can execute — author responsibility if a template constructs
`<a href="$(x)">` over untrusted URL data.

### 10.6 Deferred / forward path

| Capability | Status | Forward path |
|---|---|---|
| Per-element function tier (`tooltip = p -> @htl"..."`) | **Cut** — O(N) build footgun; per-element *values* belong in the payload | Partially covered by `$(field:raw)` (below) |
| `$(field:raw)` — unescaped field interpolation | Deferred | Explicit opt-in marker (Bokeh `{safe}`-style); pre-render HTML into a payload field, inject unescaped |
| Per-layer `tooltip_*` style override | Deferred | Non-breaking kwarg on the per-layer interactable constructor |
| Compile-time field validation (`@generated`) | Deferred | No-op on heterogeneous payloads; build-time Phase 2 runs for `NamedTuple` payloads |
| Mark-anchored tooltip placement (circles/rects/segments/polyline/polygons/grid) | **Shipped** (tooltip-anchor-chrome PR) | Box centred above the mark's top edge, gap 10px; flips below on top-clip, shifts + moves the caret (`--masque-caret-x`) on side-clip. `frontend/src/geometry.ts`'s `anchorFor`/`computeAnchoredPlacement` |
| Caret edge-flipping / viewport-collision clamping (axis/threshold/ROI/view — cursor-following) | **Shipped** (first overlay polish PR) | Card stays inside the overlay; caret flips via `.flip-x` / `.flip-y` |
| Inline date formatting | Deferred (would add `d3-time-format`) | Format dates in Julia into a payload string field |
| Following a Pluto notebook theme toggle | **N/A** — official Pluto has none | OS `prefers-color-scheme` *is* Pluto's theme (Settings is help text; no class / `data-theme` / JS event). Revisit only if Pluto ships a real override with a stable signal. |

## 11. Keyboard navigation & ARIA

The overlay `surface` is a `tabindex="0"` focus stop (`role="application"` — NVDA/JAWS's default
browse mode otherwise intercepts arrow keys before a `role="group"` element sees them). Focus
moves over a flat, manifest-order list (`frontend/src/keyboard.ts`'s `buildFocusable`) restricted
to the element-indexed kinds `:circles`/`:rects`/`:polygons`/`:segments`/`:polyline`, in the same
layer-then-element order `hitTest` resolves ties in. `:grid` is excluded even though it's
element-indexed — `hitLayerByIndex` has no pre-highlight geometry for it, its `payloads[]` is
empty by design (values are resolved client-side from `(i,j)`, not positionally), and
`ncols*nrows` is unbounded (a 1000×1000 heatmap is not something to arrow through one cell at a
time). `:axis`/`:threshold`/`:roi`/`:view` are continuous or drag-only, not element-indexed.

Keys (handled only while the surface has DOM focus): →/↓ next, ←/↑ previous (both clamp at the
ends, they don't wrap), Home/End first/last, PageDown/PageUp next/previous layer, Enter/Space
dispatch the identical `commitClick` bond payload a mouse click on the same element would (only
if the layer's `events` includes `:click`), Escape clears focus and blurs. Every handled key
calls `preventDefault`/`stopPropagation`; everything else, notably Tab, passes through untouched
— the surface must never become a keyboard trap.

The focus ring reuses the existing hover highlight (`highlight.ts`'s `drawHi`/`makeHiElement`,
mode `"hover"`) — no new visual recipe. Pointer hover and keyboard focus share one ring: a
pointer hover overwrites it and a pointer miss restores it (`hover.ts`'s `restoreFocus`, reading
a cache `keyboard.ts`'s `focusTo` populates on `OverlayState`) so there is never a moment with
two rings, or a "focused but no ring" gap when the mouse merely passes over empty canvas.

**Announcements** go to a visually-hidden `aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"` `<div>` inside
the shadow root — not the tooltip (`aria-hidden` toggling on the tooltip is a visibility signal,
not an announcement path for assistive tech). Text is `<label prefix, if set>element <n> of
<count in that layer>: <plain-text tooltip>`, debounced 150ms so a held arrow key announces only
the element you land on. `template.ts`'s `plainTextForHit`/`stripToPlain`/`renderAutoTablePlain`
produce the plain-text body (tag-stripped + entity-unescaped for the template path, a parallel
non-HTML renderer for the auto-table path — a bare tag-strip over the auto-table's markup would
announce `"amp;"` for an escaped `&`). `aria-describedby` on the surface points at a static,
non-live usage hint in the same shadow root (ARIA idrefs don't cross shadow boundaries).

The per-layer `label` field (§3, `HitLayer`) is the only manifest-shape change here — see
`perf-findings.md` for its measured wire cost. Keyboard-driving the drag interactables
(threshold/ROI/view arrow-nudge) is explicitly out of scope: three drag state machines, each
needing the same live-verification pass across both backends, is a disproportionate v1 cost for
a feature with a full mouse/touch path already.

## 12. Gesture-channel interaction contract (#102)

This section is the contract for view-manipulation gestures — drag-to-pan, 3D orbit — settled
before either backend implements it, precisely because `:cairo` and `:webgl` will implement it by
completely different mechanisms and building one first risks the mechanism getting mistaken for
the contract. Nothing here changes the committed value's path (§5, §6 Tier 2); it governs only
the frames shipped while a gesture is in progress.

### 12.1 The distinction: gesture vs. data interaction

A *gesture* is a continuous, in-progress manipulation of the view — drag-to-pan, 3D orbit — whose
intermediate states are not part of the notebook's analysis; nothing downstream reads the camera
position mid-drag. A *data interaction* is a value a downstream cell reads: a click, a keyboard
commit (§11), a `selects`-ROI release, a bounds-only `ROIInteractable` release, a threshold-drag
release, or a view-manipulation gesture's own release. These are two different channels, not two
speeds of one channel: a gesture's in-drag frames never carry a value the notebook can see, while
producing that value is the entire point of a data interaction.

For every drag interactable — ROI, threshold, view — release is a data interaction that commits
through `@bind`, exactly as a click does (§12.3). Only what happens *during* the drag differs
between them, and §12.2's rule is what decides it.

### 12.2 The routing rule

Where a value lives is decided by four questions, in order, regardless of which interactable
raises it:

0. Can the browser answer it alone from what the manifest already ships? → overlay-local, no
   channel and no Julia round trip at all (§6 Tier 0).
1. Does the notebook need this value? → `@bind`.
2. Must it survive static export? → precompute it and ship it via `published_to_js`.
3. Neither? → `AbstractPlutoDingetjes.Display.with_js_link` — a pull channel outside Pluto's state
   management.

Among the drag interactables, only a view-manipulation gesture reaches question 3. An in-drag ROI
box or threshold line answers yes to question 0 and stops there. A view-manipulation gesture
answers no to question 0, because panning or orbiting changes the image itself, not just an
overlay drawn on top of it — every hit region's projection depends on the camera, so the browser
cannot answer alone. It then answers no to questions 1 and 2 as well: nothing downstream reads the
intermediate camera state, and a static export has no kernel to drive a live gesture anyway. So it
routes to question 3. This is the reason the gesture channel exists for view manipulation and not
for ROI/threshold drags, and it is what makes §12.4's invariant a consequence of this rule rather
than a separate assertion: only a drag that changes what Julia rendered needs Julia to re-author
projection on every frame.

This four-question form is normative for every gesture, not only the view-manipulation case that
motivated it (issue #102). `roadmap.md` states questions 1–3 as its own framing note for this
work (question 0 is added here to close the ROI/threshold gap the three-question form left open);
the two must not diverge on the three they share.

### 12.3 What commits, and when

In-drag frames never touch the bond. No cell re-execution, no output replacement, no remount —
producing and displaying a frame during a drag is invisible to Pluto's reactivity entirely. The
final camera/`limits` value still commits through `@bind` on gesture release, exactly as it does
today. Commit-on-release is unchanged by this channel; it is only the in-drag frames that move off
`@bind`, not the committed value's path.

### 12.4 The invariant: projection stays Julia-authored on every frame

Because a view-manipulation gesture is the one drag that changes what Julia rendered (§12.2), any
frame the user sees during it must be accompanied by hit geometry Julia computed for *that same*
camera state. No backend may ship 3D (or 2D) coordinates to JS and reproject there. This is the
existing Julia-authored-projection principle (§2's `InteractionContext`; the client-side-GPU-camera
non-goal in §7's backend-scope note) extended to hold *per frame*, not only at commit — the
non-goal itself is untouched, and this invariant is exactly what keeps a gesture channel from
becoming the JS-driven camera that non-goal rules out. A gesture implementation that ships a new
frame without a matching manifest, or that lets JS derive geometry from a JS-owned camera, is not
a conforming implementation of this contract, regardless of how it performs.

This is what makes #87 (3D orbit preview) buildable at all: #87 is parked today because the
overlay would be a projection at the stale azimuth/elevation once the camera moves without a
matching re-projection. A gesture channel that reprojects on every frame removes that
obstruction; a mechanism that doesn't, doesn't satisfy this contract.

### 12.5 Backend obligations (mechanism-independent)

Both backends must, for every frame of a gesture:

- update the displayed frame;
- replace that frame's hit manifest atomically, so the overlay is never live over a stale frame;
- not remount;
- not re-execute a cell.

How they satisfy these obligations differs completely, and that difference is expected, not a gap
to close: `:cairo` re-renders and ships a fresh PNG plus a fresh manifest over the link; `:webgl`
patches its GPU buffers in place (#86) rather than shipping a new image. Per the standing
principle, **backends differ in cost, never in the interaction contract** — a conforming
implementation is judged against the obligations above, not against `:cairo`'s mechanism, and
whichever backend is built first must not let its mechanism get mistaken for the contract.

### 12.6 Request discipline

- One in-flight request per widget.
- Coalesce intermediate pointer moves rather than queueing them — a burst of moves collapses to
  the latest one, not a backlog to drain.
- Always await a round trip before issuing the next one. Never fire-and-forget.
- Never a fixed-interval poll. `with_js_link`'s own docstring warns that polling at a fixed
  interval can make a notebook unusable.

### 12.7 Nothing carried on this channel is notebook state

`with_js_link` bypasses Pluto's state management by design: nothing it returns is recorded in the
notebook. That is correct for transient view parameters and wrong for anything the user considers
part of their analysis. The filter is the same one §12.2's routing rule already applies: if a
downstream cell needs to read it, it does not belong on this channel — it belongs on `@bind`
instead, even if that means it isn't a gesture-channel value at all.

### 12.8 Relationship to #83

A channel that never remounts makes the double-remount described in #83 stop mattering *for
gestures specifically* — there is no remount to double. It does not fix #83, and #83 is not a
Pluto defect: a self-referencing `@bind` cell is not a sanctioned Pluto use case. Any path that
still goes through `@bind` — the committed gesture value, or any other bond — still has #83's
behaviour.

### 12.9 Open questions (left open by design)

The following are constraints a real implementation must satisfy, not answers this document
supplies. Resolving them is implementation work for whoever picks up #102, not something a
contract document should pre-empt.

- **Heavy-scene mitigation beyond `ppu=1`.** Constraint, not an answer: a render-bound heavy scene
  needs some further mitigation to hit a live-preview budget — a further downscale, a
  render-quality knob during the drag, or an accepted lower frame rate — but which one, and at
  what threshold, is unresolved. See issue #102 for the measurements establishing that the heavy
  scene is render-bound.
- **`:webgl` parity.** Constraint, not an answer: `:webgl`'s mechanism for satisfying §12.5's
  obligations is genuinely different from `:cairo`'s (in-place buffer patching, #86) and is
  unmeasured. The shared thing between the backends is the contract in this section, not any
  particular implementation of it.

The remaining two are one decision, left to the maintainer, because they interact:

- **Static export degradation.** Constraint, not an answer: a live-pull widget rendered into a
  static export has a dead link — no kernel to answer a `with_js_link` call. Whichever mechanism
  handles this, it must degrade *loudly* (say so, disable the gesture) and must **never hang**
  waiting on a response that will never come.
- **Capability detection cannot distinguish live-session from export-generation.**
  `is_supported_by_display` returns `true` *while* a static export is being generated, because a
  kernel is live at that moment to generate it — so a render-time check alone cannot tell "this
  will stay live for the reader" from "this is live only for the exporter." Constraint, not an
  answer: whatever the static-export answer above turns out to be, it cannot rely solely on a
  render-time `is_supported_by_display` check.

These two are flagged together because the export-degradation mechanism has to work correctly
precisely in the case the capability check cannot detect — so they are one decision, not two
independent ones.
