# Masque.jl — agent notes

Julia package (`Masque`, entry fn `masque`) that overlays JS interactivity on static CairoMakie
plots in Pluto. Browser layer is TypeScript in `frontend/`, bundled by esbuild to a **committed**
`assets/overlay.js`, read by Julia at `__init__`. Manifest shipped to JS via `published_to_js`.

## Commands
- Julia tests: `julia --project=. test/runtests.jl`
- Frontend gate: `cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build` (build → `../assets/overlay.js` IIFE + `../assets/masque-webgl.js` ESM)
- Format (Runic, CI-enforced): `julia -e 'using Runic; exit(Runic.main(["--inplace","src","test","bench","gallery","examples","docs"]))'` — pass every dir with `.jl`, since CI formats the whole repo (PR #11 slipped because `gallery/` was omitted here). **CI's `runic-action` has no `paths:` filter → it checks the WHOLE repo** (incl. `bench/`, `gallery/`, `examples/`, `docs/make.jl`), and tracks the latest Runic (1.7+); a locally-old Runic can pass a file CI rejects. Format every `.jl` you add, with current Runic.
- Registry name-clash check (manual, not `Pkg.test`): packed General (typical
  depot / CI) is a 129-byte `~/.julia/registries/General.toml` pointer +
  `General.tar.gz`. Package rows are inline tables (`uuid = { name = "Masque",
  path = "M/Masque" }`). `grep '^name = "X"$'` only hits `name = "General"` and
  **false-passes** if the index is missing or packed. Use
  `tar -xOf ~/.julia/registries/General.tar.gz Registry.toml | rg '{ name = "Masque"'`
  (or the unpacked `General/Registry.toml` if present). Do not assert
  unregistered in CI — that fails once General indexes the package and needs
  network.
- **Always verify CI is green before merging.** A merged PR can leave `main` red (PR #11 merged with Runic failing). After a PR's checks finish, `gh run list` / `gh pr checks <n>` must show all green — don't merge on a stale or pending run.

## Gotchas (verified this session)
- Bundle injection: inject the esbuild IIFE **unconditionally** — wrapping it in `if(!window.Masque){…}` installs `{}` not `{mount}` (block-scope heisenbug).
- Makie `Figure`s **can't `deepcopy`** (module refs) — save/restore `fig.scene.backgroundcolor[]` instead.
- `save(Stream{format"PNG"}, fig)` is broken — use `Makie.colorbuffer(fig; px_per_unit)` then `save(Stream, img_matrix)`.
- Entry fn is lowercase `masque`: a function named `Masque` clashes with `module Masque`.
- `published_to_js` needs a live Pluto — tests call `build_manifest`/`widget.manifest` directly, never `show`.
- `frontend/src/types.ts` mirrors the Julia `HitLayer`/`AxisTransform`/`Manifest` structs — keep in sync.

## Conventions
- Coords: image px, top-left origin = `Makie.project(ax.scene, pt)` + axis `viewport.origin`, ×`px_per_unit`, y-flipped. Tests assert projected coords land on rendered markers.
- DPI is derived, not fixed: `px_per_unit = 2·min(scene_width, max_width=700)` (Pluto's column).
- CI is the **sole author** of `assets/overlay.js` and `assets/masque-webgl.js` (rebuilds + commits on `main`); committing your local bundle is optional, but a stale committed bundle fails PR CI.

## GitHub-facing text (issues, comments, PR titles/bodies, reviews)
- **Never hard-wrap inside a paragraph.** One paragraph is one long line; let the browser wrap it. Hard wraps at ~80–100 chars are right for `.jl`/`.md` files in the repo and wrong on GitHub — they survive into quotes and replies, reflow badly on narrow screens, and turn a one-word edit into a multi-line diff. Blank lines between paragraphs, list items, and fenced code blocks are unaffected; wrap code inside fences as you normally would.
- Write the **corrected text, not a correction**. Issues and PRs are read as current state, not as a log of what we previously believed. Edit the body or comment in place and delete anything obsolete; don't leave "superseded", "retracting the above", or "correcting my earlier framing" paragraphs — the reader can see the thread, so a stale version plus an apology is worse than the clean version alone.
- Backtick every macro name (`@bind`, `@htl`, `@testset`, …). A bare `@word` pings the GitHub user of that name.

## Live verification (standing practice — not optional)
Unit/frontend tests assert the manifest and the JS in isolation; they don't prove the rendered
widget behaves for the user. **Any change that can alter what the user interacts with — or
what they see — must be live-verified in a real Pluto + browser on every supported backend
across the interactable kinds before it's called done** (today: CairoMakie and WGLMakie /
`:webgl`; same rule for any future backend — all backends, not one). A 2-plot kitchen-sink
is **not** enough. Agents run the playbook — do not ask the maintainer to click through
plots.

"User-facing" includes **backend/Julia-only changes**: the manifest shape, payload contents,
hit-test geometry, projection/DPI, `@bind` value, hover/tooltip text, overlay chrome, and
visual recipes all originate in Julia. The test passing is necessary, not sufficient. (E.g.
the grid `values[]` cap is a pure-Julia change with no visible markup, yet it changes hover
text and the bond payload → it gets a live check on every backend × the kinds it touches.)
- **What "live-verified" means:** on each backend, open the affected cases in headless Pluto,
  drive them with Playwright (hover/click/drag), and confirm the actual on-screen result —
  tooltip text **and** tooltip theme, highlight recipe (wash / ring / hover outline), remount
  fade (no pulse), `@bind` round-trip, geometry on the mark (not offset), no console errors —
  matches intent. Inspect the real `published_to_js` manifest in-page when the change is
  about payload shape (unit tests never call `show`). **Agents run**
  `docs/dev/live-interaction-checklist.md` via **both** `test/e2e/kind_sweep.mjs` **and**
  `test/e2e/polish_verify.mjs` (Cairo **and** WGL) across scatter, lines/segments,
  heatmap/image, barplot, poly, polar, dark-figure scatter, arrows3d, hlines/vlines,
  threshold, ROI, view-pan, and axis/colorbar. Interaction without visual is unfinished; visual
  chrome without the kind sweep is unfinished. Overlay recipes (locked — cite, do not reopen):
  highlight is a split — a brightening color-dodge fill plus a flat chrome stroke, not a mark-derived
  colour — `colors` (today `scatter!`'s `color=`) no longer touches the highlight at all, only
  the tooltip accent (below). The shadow root holds THREE sibling top-level svgs, identical
  box/viewBox, each with its own `g.hi`/`g.sel`: `svg.masque-fill` (`mix-blend-mode:
  color-dodge`, both light and dark figures) draws the fill half of a closed mark's
  hover/selected highlight (`masque-hi masque-fillshape`, computed fill `rgb(20, 20, 20)` /
  `#141414`, fill-opacity 1, no stroke); `svg.masque-edge` (no blend) draws the stroke half
  (`masque-hi masque-hover` at 1.5px hover, `masque-hi masque-wash` at 2px selected, no fill) in
  one flat chrome grey — `#7a7a7a` on a light figure, `#c8c8c8` on a dark one, the same colour
  for hover and selected — Firefox only honours `mix-blend-mode` on a top-level svg, not nested
  SVG content, which is why the dodge fill is its own sibling svg; the edge svg stays a sibling
  so the stroke paints above that fill and below the plain chrome. Dodge against the near-black `#141414` source was, across a measured
  10-colour palette, the only fill candidate that never rotated hue more than 8° and never
  dimmed a mark (`bar_blue` is the limiting case for hue rotation, so the source stays
  deliberately conservative); a single darkening layer alone made a highlighted mark read muddy
  on a light figure, which is why the highlight split into two layers at all. Because the fill is
  identical between hover and selected (same class, same colour, same opacity — fill strength
  alone is sub-JND), the 1.5px-vs-2px edge-stroke width carries the entire hover-vs-selected
  distinction. Hovering a mark that is already selected draws no highlight at all — both layers
  are already opaque from the selected wash, so a 1.5px hover stroke over the 2px selected stroke
  would read as weaker, not stronger — only the highlight is skipped; the tooltip and `@bind`
  still fire for that hit. Per geometry: a closed mark (circle/rect/polygon) draws BOTH shapes,
  identical geometry; an open seg (a line has no interior) draws the edge shape only; a
  `selects`-ROI's grid cell-block union rect (`"rectfill"` geom tag) draws the fill shape only,
  since the ROI box itself is already the rect's outline. The third svg, `svg.masque-plain` (no
  blend), holds ROI box/handles, the threshold line, the selected-open-geometry ring (2px + 4px @
  0.25, chrome grey), and hover/selected highlights for a layer with an explicit `hoverstyle`
  stroke — single element, stroke verbatim + 18%/35% tint in that colour (the pre-split recipe,
  unchanged), open shapes staying stroke-only there (no `masque-hover`, `fill: none`); browsers
  without `mix-blend-mode` draw the fill as chrome grey at 0.18 opacity, and the edge stroke
  stays the flat chrome grey. A scatter circle's highlight `r` is the
  marker's DRAWN radius, not `markersize / 2` — flush against the visible disc (default `:circle`
  marker ≈0.3525×`markersize`; a `Circle`/`Rect` geometry marker draws at `markersize`; anything
  else falls back to `markersize / 2`); the overlay's own 4px hit slack keeps clicking as
  forgiving as before. 80–120 ms fade — a plain opacity fade on each shape itself
  (`masque-enter`/`masque-leave`; the blend lives on `svg.masque-fill`, so a fading child doesn't
  isolate it); tooltip theme derived from the FIGURE's own background (CSS relative-colour
  syntax, `--masque-fig-bg`) — not just OS
  `prefers-color-scheme` (official Pluto has no notebook toggle), which is now only the
  fallback for browsers without relative-colour support — tooltip anchored ABOVE the hovered
  mark (not the cursor) with a 10px gap and the caret on the anchor — flips below on a
  top-clip, shifts + moves the caret (`--masque-caret-x`) on a side-clip; a resolvable
  per-element `colors` (currently: `scatter!`'s `color=`) adds a 3px tooltip accent border in
  that colour (`--masque-mark-border`), text stays neutral; ROI draws 4 corner handles (7 CSS px,
  white fill, 1px chrome stroke, ~1.5 CSS px corner radius; a corner resizes two axes). The four
  sides have no grip: a square on each edge midpoint, the manifest `handle` (8 logical px ×
  scaling, and at least 6 image px), still resizes that one edge, with the matching resize
  cursor. The ROI outline is
  1px chrome unless an explicit `hoverstyle` stroke sets its own width and colour;
  a `selects`-ROI's grid cell-block union rect is fill-only (no stroke, `"rectfill"` geom tag)
  — the ROI box itself is the outline, so the rect doesn't double it into two parallel edges
  (a `selected=` pre-highlight or a `selects`-ROI over `circles` keeps its stroke).
- **Skip only** pure-internal refactors with zero observable delta (and say so). When unsure,
  it's user-facing — verify all backends × the kinds the change can touch, interaction
  **and** visual.
- Mechanics below. Kind-sweep notebooks: `test/e2e/kind_sweep_cairo.jl` / `kind_sweep_webgl.jl`
  (both drivers). Demo envs (`examples/demo.jl`, `examples/webgl_demo.jl`) and
  `test/e2e/webgl_sweep.mjs` remain useful extras, not a substitute.
- CI's `kind-sweep` job runs both drivers on both backends advisorily
  (`continue-on-error: true`) — agents still run the sweep locally before calling a
  user-facing change done, until the job is promoted to a required check.

## Pluto integration testing (slow — minutes)
- A fresh per-notebook env re-resolves + precompiles the Makie stack (~6 min first open).
- To test the local package: `Pkg.develop(path=...)` in a notebook cell (disables Pluto's pkg mgmt).
- Headless: `Pluto.run(; port=1234, launch_browser=false, require_secret_for_open_links=false, require_secret_for_access=false)`; open `localhost:1234/open?path=…`; click "Run notebook code" to exit Safe preview; export HTML via `localhost:1234/notebookexport?id=…`.
- **Readiness: poll the port (`curl localhost:1234` → 200), not the log** — Pluto doesn't reliably flush its "Go to…" line, so a log-grep readiness loop hangs on a server that's actually up.
- **Selected/highlight is overlay-drawn, so the PNG is byte-identical across clicks** — don't detect interaction by watching `img.src`; assert the overlay/tooltip/`@bind` value instead (bake state into the figure only if you specifically need the PNG to differ).

## Profiling → design feedback (standing practice)
Profiling exists to inform the design, not to sit in a file. The loop is anchored on the committed
`bench/payload_envelope.jl` + `bench/stress.jl` → `docs/dev/perf-findings.md` pair.
- **`perf-findings.md` is the single source of every size/latency number.** Other docs
  (architecture/backend-comparison/roadmap) **cite** it — never restate figures (numbers
  duplicated across docs drift; one reconciliation already had to fix exactly that).
- **Re-run + reconcile whenever the wire format changes**: a new interactable kind / geometry layout, a
  new payload field (e.g. M2.3 tooltips), an encoding change, or an animation/frames slot. Each is a
  "manifest-shape change" that can invalidate the envelope. Re-run the benches, update `perf-findings.md`
  (note the commit), then grep the other docs for size/latency claims that now contradict it.
- Treat each milestone that touches the manifest as re-opening a mini Phase 0 (measure → reconcile) before
  it's marked done — same gating spirit as M5 spatial-acceleration. A whole-`docs/` reconciliation can be
  fanned out as a workflow (see how Phase 0 was propagated).

## Layout
- User docs are the Documenter site, built from `docs/src/` (`docs/make.jl`, deployed by
  `.github/workflows/Documentation.yml`). Maintainer/design docs live in `docs/dev/`
  (architecture.md = the contract; perf-findings.md = the measured payload/latency envelope +
  the single source of those numbers; frontend-delivery.md = build/delivery decisions).
  `spike/` is gitignored scratch; `bench/` holds the committed, re-runnable benchmarks.
- Process docs (brainstorming specs, implementation plans) go in `.superpowers/` — gitignored, local-only, not part of the package.
- The package was renamed from `Holo` to `Masque` on 2026-09-17 (same UUID). The local checkout folder and the GitHub remote may still be called `Holo.jl` until renamed; the package, module, and all in-repo references are `Masque`.
- Cross-references within `docs/dev/**` cite by file, not by heading anchor —
  `[§5](architecture/05-bond-value.md)`, never `[§5](architecture/05-bond-value.md#5-the-bond-value)`;
  a reference to a subsection of the *same* file is prose (`§12.3`), never a link. Keep a
  `#anchor` only when the citation targets one subsection of a genuinely long, multi-section
  file (today: `architecture/12-gesture-channel.md`, `architecture/10-tooltips.md`) and landing
  at the top would lose the reader. Rewording a heading breaks every inbound anchor link to
  it — file-level citations don't have that failure mode, so they're the default.
