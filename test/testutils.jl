# Shared fixtures for test/core/*.jl. Included (not a module) so every file that pulls
# it in gets these names at its own top level — each core/*.jl file does
# `using Test, Masque, CairoMakie, Makie` then `include(joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "testutils.jl"))`
# so it can also run standalone via `julia --project=. test/core/<file>.jl`.
#
# core_tests.jl chains all of test/core/*.jl's includes of this file into one process for
# the Core group, so the whole body is guarded to run once per session — plain redefinition
# would otherwise be harmless but noisy (a `WARNING: Method definition ... overwritten`
# per file).

    # OUTER testset's `let` — a nested `@testset`'s own `let` assigning `fig = Figure(...)`
    # reassigns that already-existing enclosing local rather than shadowing it (Julia's `let`
    # closes over a name that already exists in an enclosing scope), so later testsets
    # silently inherited whatever a previous, possibly unrelated testset last left behind
    # (see PR "Split core_tests.jl by concern with per-testset fixtures" for the audit) —
    # every testset moved out of that single-file chain now calls this instead of relying on
    # leftover state from a sibling testset.
